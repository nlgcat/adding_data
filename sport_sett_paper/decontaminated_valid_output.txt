Tim Hardaway Jr. also had a very strong showing , finishing with 23 points ( 9 - 17 FG , 3 - 9 3Pt , 2 - 3 FT ) and five assists over 36 minutes . It was just the seventh time this season that he 's reached the 20 - point mark , as he 's averaging just 11 points on the season . Jason Smith had a big game with 20 points ( 7 - 13 FG , 1 - 2 3Pt , 5 - 5 FT ) , nine rebounds and five assists over 36 minutes as well . The Hawks ' backcourt duo of Jeff Teague and Kyle Korver did their best to pull out this win for the Hawks . Teague finished with 19 points ( 7 - 17 FG , 1 - 2 3Pt , 4 - 4 FT ) , nine assists and two steals , while Korver posted 19 points ( 4 - 10 FG , 4 - 9 3Pt , 7 - 7 FT ) and five rebounds . Korver has been hitting three - pointers at a very high rate as the season has been winding down . He 's made at least three three - pointers in six of his last seven games , which bodes well for the Hawks as the playoffs begin Saturday . With Paul Millsap getting the night off in hopes of having his shoulder return closer to 100 percent , both Al Horford and DeMarre Carroll put up some points in the frontcourt . Carroll finished with 16 points ( 5 - 11 FG , 2 - 6 3Pt , 4 - 6 FT ) and four rebounds over 33 minutes , while Horford added 18 points ( 9 - 17 FG ) and six rebounds over 33 minutes . While the Hawks ' starters all played well , they just happened to run into the Knicks at the wrong time , as the Knicks played one of their best offensive games of the season . The Knicks ' final game of the season will be at home against the Detroit Pistons on Wednesday , while the Hawks will travel to Chicago to play the Bulls on Wednesday .
The Atlanta Hawks ( 11 - 6 ) went on the road and took down the Miami Heat ( 9 - 9 ) 112 - 102 on Wednesday at AmericanAirlines Arena . The Hawks got some impressive production from a few of their top players , as well as one key bench player who stepped up in limited minutes . The man getting the bulk of the attention after the win , though , is point guard Jeff Teague . Teague scored 27 points ( 8 - 11 FG , 3 - 5 3Pt , 8 - 8 FT ) to go with six assists , five rebounds and three steals in 34 minutes . He was on fire and got some help from sharpshooter Kyle Korver ( 18 points on 6 - 12 FG , 3 - 7 3Pt , 3 - 3 FT ) , as well as Paul Millsap ( 14 points on 6 - 12 FG , 1 - 1 3Pt , 1 - 3 FT ) . Both Korver and Millsap also chipped in six rebounds , while Millsap dished out five assists . The Hawks also got a nice boost off the bench from Dennis Schroder , who played 22 minutes and scored 16 points ( 6 - 9 FG , 2 - 3 3Pt , 2 - 2 Ft ) with three assists . For the Heat , it was the Chris Bosh , Dwyane Wade and Mario Chalmers show . No other player scored in double figures in this one .

The Miami Heat ( 20 - 25 ) fell to the Milwaukee Bucks ( 23 - 22 ) 109 - 102 on Tuesday at the AmericanAirlines Arena . In a game between the sixth and seventh seeds in the East , Milwaukee prevailed thanks in part to an excellent shooting performance . The Bucks finished the night shooting 55 % from the floor as a team . Miami entered Tuesday 's contest without Luol Deng and Chris Andersen , but things got worse when Dwayne Wade exited the game with a hamstring injury . Although Wade did n't injure the same hamstring that sidelined him earlier this month , it was still severe enough to force him from the game . Milwaukee improved to 13 - 12 on the road after Tuesday 's victory . Power forward Ersan Ilyasova left the game with a groin injury and did not return , but the Bucks were resilient . Milwaukee had seven players score in double figures , with four of them coming off the bench . The Bucks will look to further solidify their playoff position Thursday against the Magic in Orlando . Miami was coming off an impressive win in Chicago on Sunday , but a rash of injuries left it thin against Milwaukee . Danny Granger got the start in Deng 's place and posted 14 points , six rebounds , and two assists over 36 minutes . Hassan Whiteside , who garnered national attention with his 12 block performance against the Bulls on Sunday , had another strong game . Whiteside moved into the starting lineup and finished the game with 16 points and 16 rebounds , but ironically did not record a block against the Bucks . The Heat have two days off to get healthy before taking the floor Friday against the Mavericks .
The New_Orleans Pelicans ( 28 - 27 ) defeated the Miami Heat ( 22 - 31 ) , 105 - 91 . Anthony Davis and Ryan Anderson exited the game due to injury and never returned .

Udonis Haslem started Monday at power forward in place of Bosh , playing 23 minutes with four points and seven rebounds . Luol Deng lit up the 76ers for 29 points on 11 - of - 14 shooting , which was his best scoring performance since dropping 30 on the Dallas Mavericks back on Nov. 9 . Newly acquired point guard Goran Dragic had his first double - double in a Heat jersey , with 23 points and 10 assists .

Nerlens Noel also had his second - biggest outing of the season in terms of points , scoring 18 to go along with seven boards and four blocked shots . JaVale McGee , who came over in a trade from the Nuggets last week , is averaging just 3 points and 2 rebounds in 12 minutes in three contests since he was acquired . Philadelphia has dropped four straight games , and the only team looking up at them in the Eastern Conference standings are the lowly New York Knicks . The 76ers will travel to Milwaukee to take on the Bucks on Wednesday , in a what could be Michael Carter-Williams ' ( toe ) Bucks debut against his former team . Meanwhile , the Heat will take on their division foe , the Magic , in Orlando on Wednesday .
The Miami Heat ( 31 - 36 ) defeated the Portland Trail_Blazers ( 44 - 22 ) 108 - 104 on Wednesday in Miami .

Hassan Whiteside recorded a double - double of his own , recording 12 points on 6 - of - 11 shooting and 10 rebounds in 33 minutes . LaMarcus Aldridge had a monster game in the Trail_Blazers ' losing effort , posting 34 points on 15 - of - 24 shooting and 12 rebounds in 37 minutes . This was Aldridge 's third double - double in a row and his fourth in the last five games . His effort was not enough though , as just two other Portland players scored in double figures . Damian Lillard scored 17 points on 7 - of - 13 shooting in 35 minutes and Arron Afflalo scored 15 points on 5 - of - 13 shooting in 33 minutes . The loss moves the Trail_Blazers to fourth place in the Western Conference , as they are now a half game behind the Rockets for third place and two games behind the Grizzlies for second .

The Miami Heat ( 35 - 43 ) defeated the Charlotte Hornets ( 33 - 44 ) 105 - 100 on Tuesday at American Airlines Arena in Miami . With just four games left in the season following this one , this was another huge win for the Heat , who have now moved just a half game back from the Boston Celtics for the eighth and final projected playoff seed in the Eastern Conference standings . They had previously lost four in a row and seven of their last ten , so this was a huge sigh of relief for the Heat . Conversely , it was very tough loss for the Hornets , who also remain in reach of that final playoff spot . The loss brings them to two games back from the Celtics , so they 're officially in desperation mode for their final five outings . The Heat were the superior shooters in this game , going 49 percent from the field , while the Hornets finished at 43 percent . They were led by point guard Goran Dragic , who scored a team - high of 28 points ( 10 - 16 FG , 0 - 2 3Pt , 8 - 8 FT ) , to go along with five assists and two steals . His shot looks to be dialed in at the moment , as he 's combined to shoot an impressive 16 - for - 26 from the field to score 43 points over his last two games . Luol Deng also played a big factor in the win . He posted 21 points ( 9 - 17 FG , 1 - 6 3Pt , 2 - 2 FT ) and six rebounds , while playing 41 minutes . After recording just three points on 1 - of - 8 shooting from the field in Sunday 's game against the Pacers , he got back on track with this line , and the Heat will need him to continue to stay hot if they want to push themselves into the playoffs . Dwyane Wade had a strong showing as well with 19 points ( 6 - 17 FG , 0 - 1 3Pt , 7 - 10 FT ) and five assists . He did have a season - high of seven turnovers though , so it was n't all good for the guard . It was Gerald Henderson that kept the Hornets close though . Henderson went 11 - for - 18 from the field and 2 - for - 3 from the three - point line to score a game - high of 29 points before fouling out . It was his second highest points total of the season , as he was able to shoot higher than 60 percent from the floor . Kemba Walker had decent showing as well . In 39 minutes , he finished with 17 points ( 7 - 20 FG , 0 - 4 3Pt , 3 - 5 FT ) , four assists and three steals . He 's now combined for 41 points and six assists over his last two games , but he 'll need to do even more if the Hornets want any chance at sneaking into the playoffs . Recording a double - double , Bismack Biyombo chipped in with 12 points ( 4 - 6 FG , 4 - 6 FT ) , 12 rebounds and four blocked shots . Getting the start and extended playing time with both Al Jefferson and Cody Zeller sidelined , Biyombo was able to record one of his better statistical outings of the season . Mo Williams added 15 points ( 5 - 17 FG , 0 - 4 3Pt , 5 - 5 FT ) and four assists off the bench . The Heat 's next game will be at home against the Chicago Bulls on Thursday , while the Hornets will be at home against the Toronto Raptors on Wednesday .
On opening night for both teams , the Hornets held off the Bucks 108 - 106 in overtime . Milwaukee got off to a hot start , shooting nearly 53 percent from the field en route to a 57 - 46 halftime advantage . A Brandon Knight-led run early in the third quarter pushed the lead up to 24 points , but the new - look Hornets would fight back . Charlotte outscored Milwaukee 32 - 15 in the final period , slowly chipping away at the lead by stifling the Bucks’ ballhandlers on the defensive end . Brandon Knight and Khris Middleton committed some key turnovers down the stretch , setting the stage for Kemba Walker’s heroics . Walker , who signed a four - year , $ 48 million extension Tuesday , converted a layup to bring the Hornets within two points with seven seconds to play . Then , after Middleton made 1 - of - 2 free throws , Walker came off a high screen and drilled a running three - pointer with less than two seconds remaining to send the game into overtime . A pair of Jabari Parker free throws gave the bucks the early overtime lead , but with the game tied at 106 with 16 seconds left , Charlotte again looked to Walker . He sized up Knight at the top of the key and connected on a tough , step - back jumper to give Charlotte a 108 - 106 advantage with five seconds remaining . Following a timeout , the Bucks were able to get Middleton an open look , but he misfired from the left wing as time expired . Knight led the way for Milwaukee , scoring 22 points ( 5 - 17 FG , 10 - 10 FT ) to go with 13 assists and eight rebounds . O.J. Mayo added 17 points off the bench , and Parker chipped in eight to go with four boards . Middleton finished with 17 points and six rebounds . It was a tough Hornets debut for Lance Stephenson , who finished with just seven points on 3 - of - 12 shooting . However , he added eight assists and a team - high 13 boards . Walker led all scorers with 26 points , while Al Jefferson chipped in 14 to go with 10 rebounds . The Bucks now head back to Milwaukee to host the 76ers on Friday . Charlotte hosts Marc Gasol and the Grizzlies on Saturday .
The Los_Angeles Clippers ( 8 - 5 ) defeated the Charlotte Hornets ( 4 - 11 ) 113 - 92 on Monday at Time Warner Cable Arena in Charlotte .

The superior shooting , along with out - rebounding the Hornets 43 - 33 , gave the Clippers the advantage and put them on track for the victory . The Clippers had six players reach double figures in scoring Monday . Blake Griffin came one assist shy of a triple - double , as he had a monster line of 22 points , 16 rebounds and nine assists . He really seemed to struggle against the Memphis Grizzlies on Sunday , so this was a nice bounce back game for Griffin . Along with Griffin , Chris Paul was able to contribute 22 points ( 10 - 16 FG , 2 - 5 3Pt ) , while also handing out 15 assists . The 15 assists were a season - high for Paul , and it marked his seventh double - double of the season . Jamal Crawford also continued to make his presence known off the bench , as he shot 8 - for - 13 from the field and 5 - for - 8 from the three - point line to score 21 points in 26 minutes . In the last two games , he 's now combined for 40 points . The Hornets just did n't have the offensive fire power to keep up with the Clippers . Al Jefferson was one of the leaders for the team , as he finished with 16 points and nine rebounds . It was the first time in three games that he failed to reach the 20 - point mark . Kemba Walker had an inefficient 15 points , as he shot only 4 - for - 11 from the field and 0 - for - 4 from the three - point line.He scored the bulk of his points at the free throw line where he went 7 - for - 8 on the night .

Charlotte drew a matchup with the East 's top team at the right time , with Atlanta resting four starters and Jeff Teague sitting out with a sprained ankle . The Hawks ' reserves - turned - starters fared well against the Hornets , but the Hornets ' lineup proved to be too much in the end . The Hawks cut the lead to single - digits in the fourth , but the Hornets , led by Mo Williams ' shooting , put them away . Williams finished with 18 points off the bench and made four of his five attempts from beyond the arc . The Hornets lead the season series 2 - 1 and they will meet one last time during the regular season on April 10 . Atlanta was coming off a 99 - 86 victory over Miami on Friday to clinch the top seed in the Eastern Conference . As a result , coach Mike Budenholzer did n't feel pressed to deploy his starters for the second game of a back - to - back set .

Al Jefferson had just two points in 17 minutes on the floor . The Hornets are now just a game out of the eighth seed in the Eastern Conference and will have a chance at another big win on Monday when they host the Celtics .
The Toronto Raptors ( 46 - 32 ) defeated the Charlotte Hornets ( 33 - 45 ) 92 - 74 on Wednesday in Charlotte .

DeMar DeRozan led the way for Toronto , scoring 18 points ( 6 - 16 FG , 6 - 7 FT ) , to go along with seven assists and three blocks in 31 minutes . Lou Williams provided solid scoring off the bench , putting up 16 points ( 5 - 15 FG , 3 - 8 3Pt ) in 26 minutes .

Amir Johnson missed his second consecutive game . Tyler Hansbrough got the start and logged a double - double with 12 points and 12 rebounds in 37 minutes .

This game was a must - win for both teams as Charlotte and Indiana are battling for one of the final playoff spots in the Eastern Conference .

The Hornets shot 30 percent from the floor for much of the game , but were able to bump that number up to 35 percent when the game was already well out of hand . With the win , the Pacers locked up the head - to - head tiebreaker over the Hornets , which could be the deciding factor for the eighth spot in the East .

While Russell Westbrook did everything he could to bring the Thunder back in this game , he just did n't get enough help in the end , as the Thunder took the loss . This was a tough defeat for the Thunder , as it pushes them to a half - game back from the New Orleans Pelicans for the final projected playoff spot in the West . The Pelicans play the Houston Rockets on Sunday as well , so they could extend their lead to a full game . The Pacers , on the other hand , remain alive in the East with their fifth straight win . They 're now even with the Brooklyn Nets for the final playoff spot in the East , although the Nets hold the tie breaker over them , so they 'll likely need to win their last two games in order to pass up the Nets .

He went 9 - for - 14 from the field and 6 - for - 8 from the three - point line to score a team - high of 30 points , while also posting 10 rebounds .

The double - double was his third in a row , a stretch where he 's averaging 13 points and 11 rebounds per game . Including some clutch buckets during the final few minutes of the game , George Hill added 19 points ( 6 - 10 FG , 2 - 3 3Pt , 5 - 7 FT ) and seven assists over 40 minutes . He shot just 2 - of - 6 from the field in Friday 's game against the Pistons , so the guard was able to get pointed back in the right direction Sunday . Westbrook did everything he could to try and pick up the win for the Thunder . Westbrook took nearly half of the teams ' total shot attempts in this one , recording a ridiculous 43 field goal attempts , while converting on 21 of them . He finished with a monster line of 54 points ( 21 - 43 FG , 5 - 15 3Pt , 7 - 11 FT ) , nine rebounds and eight assists over 40 minutes , but he just did n't get enough help from his teammates to convert those impressive numbers into a win . Westbrook has combined for 81 points over his last two games alone . Dion Waiters and Enes Kanter were the only other two Thunder players to reach double figures in points . Waiters posted 16 points ( 7 - 16 FG , 2 - 5 3Pt , 0 - 4 FT ) and two rebounds , while Kanter recorded 13 points ( 5 - 11 FG , 1 - 1 3Pt , 2 - 3 FT ) , five rebounds and a block .

Neither team reached the 50 - point mark until the 4:20 mark in the third quarter when John Wall found Marcin Gortat for an easy layup . The teams went back - and - forth throughout the fourth quarter , but a missed John Wall floater at the buzzer sent the game into overtime . One overtime was n't enough to decide the outcome , however , as the Pacers and Wizards mustered just four points apiece in the first extra period . Indiana 's George Hill clutch three - pointer in the second OT gave the Pacers a five point lead with under 30 seconds remaining to help seal the victory . The Pacers are in position to clinch the East 's final playoff spot with a win Wednesday against the Grizzlies or a Nets loss . Washington entered Tuesday with the fifth seed in hand , but decided to play its starters against a playoff caliber team . Nene Hill was sidelined with an ankle injury , which moved veteran Drew Gooden into the starting lineup . Five different Wizards logged over 40 minutes of playing time , led by Marcin Gortat and John Wall with 44 minutes . Wall finished with 16 points on 7 - of - 23 shooting and added 11 assists while Gortat posted 19 points and 10 rebounds . Washington will finish wrap up the regular season Wednesday in Cleveland . Indiana lost seven out of eight in late March to temporarily fall out of a playoff spot , but its current six - game win streak has given it control of its playoff destiny .

He shot 9 - for - 14 from the field and 1 - for - 2 from the three - point line to score 22 points in 36 minutes . He 's only averaging 7 points in 18 minutes per game this season , so the boost in playing time allowed him to surprise many with the dominant performance .

Coming off the bench , Ray McCallum had 12 points ( 4 - 7 FG , 0 - 3 3Pt , 4 - 4 FT ) in 19 minutes . For the Pelicans , Anthony Davis was n't his normal self tonight .

The Kings ' next game will be on the road against the Houston Rockets on Wednesday , while the Pelicans will travel to Atlanta to play the Hawks on Friday .

As a result , they 've lost six of their last seven games . Tony Parker returned for the last two games but did not play Friday , and it 's unlcear whether he was simply being rested on the second game of a back - to - back set or if he aggravated his hamstring injury .

The New_Orleans Pelicans ( 30 - 27 ) defeated the Brooklyn Nets ( 23 - 32 ) 102 - 96 on Wednesday at the Smoothie King Center in New_Orleans .

They went 51 percent from the field and 44 percent from the three - point line , while the Nets went 42 percent from the floor and 33 percent from deep . What really kept the Nets in this game was their ability to force the Pelicans into turnovers , as the Pelicans had 20 turnovers compared to just 12 from the Nets . This was a big win for the Pelicans , as they continue to trail the Thunder for the final projected playoff spot in the Western Conference standings . Seemingly coming out of nowhere , Quincy Pondexter was a huge reason the Pelicans were able to grab a win , despite missing both Anthony Davis and Ryan Anderson . He went 9 - for - 13 from the field and 4 - for - 8 from the three - point line to finish with a game - high of 25 points , to go along with five rebounds . It was a new season - high for Pondexter in just his fourth start of the year , as it was his first time breaking the 20 - point mark . Tyreke Evans also had a strong showing , posting 15 points ( 5 - 13 FG , 1 - 4 3Pt , 4 - 6 FT ) , 11 assists and two blocked shots . It was his third double - double over his last four games , a stretch where he 's averaged 14 points and 10 assists . As long as Davis is out , Evans should continue to be the go - to player on offense . Notching a double - double of his own , Omer Asik recorded 12 points ( 5 - 6 FG , 2 - 2 FT ) and 13 rebounds . He 's combined for 26 points and 24 rebounds over his last two games . Both Norris Cole and Alexis Ajinca reached double figures in points off the bench , with 11 and 10 points respectively .

He 's played well of late , averaging 19 points and eight rebounds over his last three games . A big reason for the Nets keeping this game close was their bench though , who combined to score 49 of the teams 96 points . Thaddeus Young was one of those players , as he went off for 19 points ( 8 - 12 FG , 1 - 1 3Pt , 2 - 4 FT ) and five rebounds .

Milwaukee fell 98 - 95 for its second consecutive defeat after losing to the Bulls on Wednesday . The Bucks , who shot 47 percent from the floor and 25 percent ( 5 - of - 20 ) from three , trailed by four entering the fourth quarter but were never able to completely erase the lead . A Parker steal and dunk trimmed the deficit to two with 1:28 to play , but Greg Monroe responded with a basket on the other end . Then , following a Brandon Knight layup , Josh Smith rebounded a Kentavious Caldwell-Pope airball and laid it in , pushing the lead back to four . Caron Butler would go on to close the game out at the free throw line . For the second straight game , the Bucks got production from a number of sources , as 10 players saw double - digit minutes .

The Detroit Pistons ( 24 - 43 ) defeated the Memphis Grizzlies ( 47 - 21 ) 105 - 95 on Tuesday at the Palace of Auburn Hills . Coming close to playing themselves completely out of the playoffs after losing 10 games in a row , the Pistons gave themselves some hope Tuesday , as they came out with a 10 - point win over the Grizzlies . The win brings them within six and half games of the Miami Heat for the final projected playoff seed in the Eastern Conference , but they will still need to keep on winning with just 15 games left in the season . The Grizzlies , on the other hand , continue to sit as the second seed in the West , seven games behind the Golden State Warriors , but just one and a half games ahead of the Portland Trail Blazers . They 've lost five of their last ten games now , but they will still likely finish in the top half of the standings if they do n't go on some extended losing streak in the near future . A big part of the win should be attributed to the Pistons ' defense , as they forced the Grizzlies into 18 turnovers , while committing just nine of their own . Reggie Jackson led the way on the offensive side of the ball though , scoring 23 points ( 10 - 18 FG , 2 - 5 3Pt , 1 - 1 FT ) , while also handing out a ridiculous season - high of 20 assists . It was only his third game posting double - digit assists this season , while this arguably marked his best game since joining the Pistons at the trade deadline . Andre Drummond notched a double - double of his own , finishing with 16 points ( 6 - 12 FG , 4 - 6 FT ) , 16 rebounds and five blocked shots . He had suffered a concussion during Saturday 's game , but cleared the concussion protocol prior to this matchup and played as if there were no lingering problems . With Greg Monroe sitting out due to a knee injury , Anthony Tolliver moved into the starting lineup . He took advantage of the start and recorded 15 points ( 4 - 12 FG , 4 - 9 3Pt , 3 - 4 FT ) and seven rebounds . After failing to reach double - digit points in nine straight games , he 's now gone two straight with 14 points or more . Kentavious Caldwell-Pope had a solid shooting effort as well and added 24 points ( 10 - 16 FG , 2 - 7 3Pt , 2 - 3 FT ) in 37 minutes . With Mike Conley sidelined due to an ankle injury , it was the Grizzlies ' frontcourt that had the most production , despite still suffering the loss . Gasol posted a double - double with 17 points ( 6 - 11 FG , 1 - 1 3Pt , 4 - 4 FT ) , 11 rebounds and six assists . He had scored less than his season average of 18 points per game in each of his last three outings , so it was good to see the center get back on track Tuesday . Jeff Green was locked in with his shot , going 7 - for - 12 from the field and 3 - for - 3 from the three - point line to score a team - high of 21 points . He 's now pushed his season averages to 15 points and 4 rebounds on the year . Zach Randolph and Vince Carter were the only other players in double figures for points . Randolph finished with 13 points ( 6 - 13 FG , 1 - 1 FT ) and five rebounds , while Carter had 14 points ( 4 - 8 FG , 4 - 6 3Pt , 2 - 2 FT ) and three rebounds off the bench . The Pistons ' next game will be on the road against the Philadelphia 76ers on Wednesday , while the Grizzlies will travel to Dallas to play the Mavericks on Friday .

Miami had a golden opportunity to tie Brooklyn in the standings after the Nets were routed in Atlanta earlier Saturday , but let this game slip away for a gut - wrenching loss . The Heat appeared to be on their way to a victory with a seemingly comfortable 12 point lead with 4:13 to go , but the Pistons battled back with a 14 - 3 run . Dwayne Wade , who had been efficient from the floor through three quarters , missed all four of his field goal attempts in the fourth quarter . Wade 's miss with 10 seconds to go led to Reggie Jackson 's go ahead layup with five ticks left on the clock . The Heat 's playoff hopes now hang in the balance with several teams within one game of overtaking them . Miami appeared to be a lock for the playoffs two weeks ago , but a 2 - 6 record over its last eight games has put its post season hopes in serious jeopardy . Dwayne Wade was able to play 35 minutes on a banged up knee , which he aggravated Thursday in Cleveland . He finished with 24 points , but could n't convert down the stretch . The Heat are in direct competition with the Pacers and Hornets for one of the final two spots in the East , which could be a blessing or a curse depending on how they perform against them in their next two games . Miami draws a matchup in Indiana on Sunday before hosting Charlotte on Tuesday . Detroit gave Miami a scare late in their last meeting , but it was able to complete the comeback Saturday with a big win .

The Thunder were able to keep their playoff hopes alive with the win over the Blazers . The New Orleans Pelicans also came out with a win on Monday , so both the Thunder and Pelicans remain tied for the eighth and final projected playoff seed in the West . The Pelicans own the tiebreaker though , so in order for the Thunder to get into the playoffs , they 'll need a win of their own , as well as a Pelican 's loss on Wednesday in the finale . The Trail_Blazers , on the other hand , have locked up the fourth seed in the West . It 's still up in the air who they 'll end up having to play , but it could be either the San Antonio Spurs , Houston Rockets , Memphis Grizzlies or Los Angeles Clippers . Despite finishing with worse shooting percentages than the Blazers , the Thunder came out with a huge advantage on the boards , out - rebounding them 58 - 35 . It was the duo of Enes Kanter and Russell Westbrook who helped keep the Thunder in playoff contention . Westbrook went 13 - for - 27 from the field and 2 - for - 5 from the three - point line to score a game - high of 36 points , to go along with 11 rebounds and seven assists . He 's been absolutely phenomenal throughout the whole second half of this season and he continues to put all the pressure on his own shoulders here in the final stretch , as he 's averaging a ridiculous 39 points , 7 rebounds and 7 assists over his last three games . Kanter , on the other hand , finished with 27 points ( 13 - 20 FG , 1 - 2 FT ) and 13 rebounds over 36 minutes . Kanter has scored over 20 points in five of his last seven games , a seven - game stretch where he 's averaging 21 points . Dion waiters ( 4 - 21 FG , 0 - 5 3Pt , 5 - 5 FT ) and Anthony Morrow ( 4 - 10 FG , 2 - 7 3Pt , 1 - 2 FT ) were the only other two players in double figures with 13 and 11 points respectively . Already heavily hit by the injury bug , this was another damaging game for the Blazers , as both Nicolas Batum and C.J. McCollum had to leave the game with injuries . McCollum went down with a nasty looking ankle injury , while Batum 's leg appeared to buckle as he went down with a knee injury . It 's an awful amount of bad luck for this Trail_Blazers ' team , who could now go into the playoffs very shorthanded . With Aldridge also sitting this game out due to a foot injury , it was Meyers Leonard who led this team while in the starting lineup . Leonard posted a season - high of 24 points ( 9 - 17 FG , 5 - 9 3Pt , 1 - 1 FT ) , while also adding four rebounds and a blocked shot over 32 minutes . He 'll go into the season finale averaging 6 points and 5 rebounds in his second season as a pro . Damian Lillard did n't have his best showing of the season , posting just 10 points ( 3 - 9 FG , 1 - 4 3Pt , 3 - 4 FT ) and six assists in the loss . After going off for 28 points in Saturday 's game against the Jazz , it was a disappointing performance for Lillard , who will need to play much better in the playoffs if the Blazers want any shot at making it past the first round . Joel Freeland added 16 points ( 8 - 13 FG ) and five rebounds off the bench , while Chris Kaman chipped in with 14 points ( 7 - 9 FG ) and four rebounds .

The Los_Angeles Lakers ( 8 - 16 ) defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves ( 5 - 18 ) 100 - 94 on Sunday . Los_Angeles has strung together three straight wins with their new starting lineup . Ironically enough , most of their success can be pointed to the improved play of their bench since Jeremy Lin and Carlos Boozer were moved into reserve roles . Taking Boozer and Lin out of the starting lineup allows Kobe Bryant to operate unecumbered as the loan dominant offensive player in the starting lineup while giving Lin and Boozer possessions off the bench that do n't require Bryant to force his touches . Boozer led the Lakers on Sunday with a bygone double - double of 22 points and 13 rebounds in 27 minutes . The Lakers will look to continue their recent success when they take on the woeful Indiana Pacers on Monday . Bryant 's 26 points vaulted him over Michael Jordan in career points to land at third all - time for the NBA scoring record . Minnesota has lost two straight games , but wins and losses are no longer the focus of the Timberwolves ' season as president Flip Saunders told the media this week that the team 's focus is now on rebuilding for the future , a path Saunders did not plan to walk down this season . However , with Ricky Rubio ( ankle ) , Kevin Martin ( wrist ) and Nikola Pekovic ( wrist ) all expected to miss as much as another month of action , Minnesota 's hopes of competing for a playoff spot this season were dashed . They 'll embark on a two - game road trip Tuesday in Washington against the Wizards .

He too was in his second game back , after missing two games with a hip injury . Zach LaVine played eight minutes off the bench . He has an ankle injury and sat out Minnesota 's previous two games . 2014 first - overall pick Andrew Wiggins had a rough game , posting just six points on 2 - of - 8 from the field to go along with five rebounds and four fouls in 37 minutes .

They were led by Louis Williams , who put in a team - high 18 points in 26 minutes off the bench . Toronto has the same record as the Chicago Bulls as they 'll battle for playoff position the rest of the regular season . The banged up Wolves played just eight players against the Raptors . Probably rookie of the year Andrew Wiggins was the man against his hometown team . He put in 25 points to go along with five boards , five assists , two blocks and one steal .

Damian Lillard scored a game - high 23 points , while LaMarcus Aldridge posted a double - double of 18 points and 13 rebounds . The Blazers will embark on a five - game road trip that begins Sunday against the New York Knicks . Indiana moved fill - in starter Donald Sloan to a bench role and installed Rodney Stuckey as the starter at point guard so that they could move Chris Copeland 's shooting into the starting lineup on the wing . Copeland did n't fulfill his promise Thurdsday , shooting just 2 - of - 9 from the field in 20 minutes . Stuckey put up 16 points and five assists in 29 minutes , and Sloan fell completely out of the rotation , failing to see a single minute off the bench .

Starting center Robin Lopez suffered a broken hand in the game and is expected to be sidelined for a considerable amount of time . San_Antonio has lost three of their last five , and surprisingly , the team continues to rest several of their key players despite losing games .

Portland had lost eight of its last ten games , including an 0 - 3 road trip last week , coming into Tuesday 's contest and was desperate for a win . Utah hung tough with Portland and made things very interesting when Joe Ingles ' three pointer brought the Jazz within two points with just under 10 seconds to go in the game . However , LaMarcus Aldridge 's free throws put the game out of reach for the Jazz as Portland notched a much - needed win . Utah has been a thorn in the side for the West 's top teams of late , coming within five points of the Clippers and securing a surprising win over Golden State last week . Gordon Hayward led all scorers with 27 points on 10 - of - 16 shooting . Dante Exum started at point guard again , but only logged 20 minutes on the floor and was held scoreless while Trey Burke put up 18 points in 34 minutes .

The Blazers were the much better shooting team in this one , going 49 percent from the field and 36 percent from the three - point line , while the Timberwolves finished at 38 percent from the floor and just 27 percent from deep .

It marked his second straight double - double , a stretch where he 's combined for 45 points and 25 rebounds . Fellow superstar Damian Lillard also played a factor in the victory . He did n't shoot the best , but he still finished with 17 points ( 4 - 13 FG , 3 - 8 3Pt , 6 - 6 FT ) and six assists . He was coming off a 36 - point showing on Monday , so it was somewhat of a let down performance . Like Aldridge , Robin Lopez also had success against the Timberwolves frontcourt . He went 7 - for - 8 from the field and 4 - for - 4 from the free throw line to score 18 points , while adding six rebounds as well . Coming off the bench , CJ McCollum chipped in with 13 points ( 6 - 12 FG , 1 - 5 3Pt ) over 25 minutes .

He had posted his second career double - double on Tuesday , so this marked another nice contribution for the young guard . Kevin Martin also added 17 points ( 5 - 15 FG , 1 - 3 3Pt , 6 - 6 FT ) and three rebounds . Coming off the bench , Chase Budinger was the final Timberwolves player to reach double figures , as he finished with 12 points and five steals .

Tim Duncan had himself a double - double in the contest , with 12 points ( 5 - 13 FG , 2 - 3 FT ) and 13 rebounds ; he added three assists and two turnovers , while turning the ball over once . Tony Parker posted an equally impressive line of 28 points ( 11 - 17 FG , 2 - 2 3Pt , 4 - 4 FT ) , seven assists , one rebound , and one turnover in 30 minutes of action . Warriors ' guard Klay Thompson exploded Thursday for 29 points ( 9 - 17 FG , 5 - 6 3Pt , 6 - 6 FT ) . His effort was n't enough , though , as Golden_State turned the ball over way too frequently , finishing with a total of 19 as a team . Harrison Barnes chipped in with a season - high 22 points ( 9 - 12 FG , 1 - 3 3Pt , 3 - 4 FT ) and Stephen Curry added 16 ( 7 - 18 FG , 0 - 7 3Pt , 2 - 2 FT ) .

He put up 30 points and 15 rebounds in 38 minutes , but the team shot just 42 percent from the field and 20 percent from beyond the three - point line . Despite an impressive top - six players on their roster , the Pelicans are woefully thin on the bench , and the absence of Eric Gordon ( shoulder ) has impacted their ability to win games more than it should , but coach Monty Williams has been unable to find a viable fill - in on his bench . Gordon is n't returning any time soon , and New_Orleans is n't going to have it much easier Saturday when they continue their road trip in Los Angeles against the Clippers .
James Harden scored 34 points , but it wasn’t enough to overcome a fourth quarter run by Golden_State , as the Rockets fell 105 - 93 on Wednesday . Playing without Dwight Howard , as well as a number of other key reserves , Houston shot 42 percent from the floor and 9 - of - 35 from beyond the arc .

It was some nice production from the guard , with this being his highest scoring performance since the beginning of February .

Sacramento led by as many as 21 early in the third quarter before Washington woke up and went on a 21 - 6 run to narrow the gap .

The Washington Wizards ( 46 - 34 ) defeated the Atlanta Hawks ( 60 - 20 ) 108 - 99 on Sunday in Washington . It was a game where neither team had much to play for , as the Hawks are locked in as the No . 1 seed in the Eastern Conference , while the Wizards are locked in as the No . 5 seed . The only difference Sunday night was that Atlanta rested their starters , while Washington played at full strength .

He went 6 - of - 12 from the field and 2 - for - 6 from the three - point line to score a team - high of 23 points , while also adding eight assists and a pair of steals . Lowry is on fire right now , combining for 46 points , 17 assists and five steals over his last two games . Luis Scola was another player who had a strong showing Wednesday . In just 18 minutes of playing time , he scored an efficient 21 points ( 10 - 15 FG , 3 - 4 FT ) , to go along with five rebounds and a steal . The points total was a new season high for the eighth - year pro out of Argentina , who 's now averaging 8 points , 7 rebounds and 1 assists on the season . Leading all bench players , Cory Jefferson provided a nice spark for the Raptors . He chipped in with 15 points ( 6 - 9 FG , 0 - 1 3Pt , 3 - 3 FT ) and five assists over 30 minutes . Rookie Jahlil Okafor did everything he could to keep the Sixers in the game . Okafor finished with a game - high of 26 points ( 13 - 22 FG , 0 - 2 FT ) , 16 of which came in the first half , while also adding seven rebounds and four blocked shots . Okafor continues to show himself as one of the top rookies in his class , now averaging a class - leading 20 points , 7 rebounds and 1 assists on the year . He 's now surpassed the 20 - point plateau in five of the first eight games of his NBA career . While Okafor was the only starter who really got into a rhythm , Hollis Thompson and Isaiah Canaan had solid showings off the bench . They combined to shoot 11 - for - 19 from the field and 10 - for - 16 from beyond the arc for 37 points . With Robert Covington still sidelined due to a knee injury , both players saw increased porduction Wednesday , but it was n't enough to keep the Sixers close .

The Denver Nuggets ( 8 - 13 ) won their second straight close game , defeating the Philadelphia 76ers ( 1 - 20 ) 108 - 105 on Saturday . Down 59 - 52 at the half , the Nuggets flipped the switch in the fourth quarter , outscoring the Sixers 30 - 19 in the final period to secure their second consecutive victory . In a game featuring two of the more permeable frontcourts in the league , Denver outrebounded Philadelphia 47 to 40 and outscored them in the paint , 44 to 34 . The Sixers were further weakened up front by the absence of standout rookie Jahlil Okafor , who was serving the second game of a team - imposed two - game suspension for recent off - the - court issues . Danilo Gallinari , as he has often done this season , spearheaded the Nuggets ' offensive attack with a 24 - point , seven - rebound performance , his second consecutive game over the 20 - point mark . The visitors also got a strong outing off the bench from Will Barton , who is certainly in contention for the Sixth Man of the Year award at this point . Barton contributed 16 points , and added nine rebounds , an assist and a steal over 33 minutes to come in second behind Gallinari in team scoring . For the starters , Randy Foye turned in another solid start in place of Gary Harris , notching 11 points , five rebounds , an assist and a steal . Rookie Emmanuel Mudiay only shot 33 percent but managed to pitch in 10 points , six assists , five rebounds and a steal . He did commit seven turnovers , underscoring an area of his game he must continue to focus on . Kenneth Faried came off the bench for 22 minutes and was a rebound shy of a double - double , pouring in 12 points and hauling in nine boards . Jameer Nelson was the third Denver player to manage double - digit points in a reserve role , posting 10 points , three assists and a pair of rebounds . Denver improved to 8 - 13 but remains in last place in the Western Conference 's Northwest Division . They head home for a date with the Orlando Magic on Tuesday . The Sixers turned in a valiant effort without Okafor , but could n't hold on to the lead in the second half . All five starters notably turned in double - digit scoring performances , led by Robert Covington 's 18 - point , 10 - rebound double - double . The starting backcourt duo of Isaiah Canaan and T.J. McConnell were also solid contributors , tallying 15 and 10 points , respectively . McConnell in particular stuffed the stat sheet by adding eight rebounds , six assists and three steals . Nerlens Noel ( 14 points , five rebounds , two blocks ) and Jerami Grant ( 10 points , two assists , a rebound , four steals and a pair of blocks ) pitched in all over the court as well . Jakarr Sampson ( 13 points ) and Richaun Holmes ( 10 points ) also got in on the act from the bench , making it one of the best team efforts for Philadelphia in what has been a miserable campaign to date . The Sixers fell to 1 - 20 and remain last in the Eastern Conference 's Atlantic Division . They are home for a tough matchup versus the San Antonio Spurs on Monday .
The Cleveland Cavaliers ( 26 - 9 ) defeated the Philadelphia 76ers ( 4 - 36 ) 95 - 85 on Sunday . The Cavs likely got more than they bargained for from a game Sixers squad that played them tough through all four quarters . Philadelphia 's collective defensive effort may have been the most surprising aspect of the game overall , as they managed to hold a hot Cleveland offense to a mediocre 39 percent shooting performance from the field , and 28 percent from beyond the arc . To provide some more tangible perspective on the noteworthiness of the Sixers ' effort , one has to realize the Cavs had tallied 53 and 48 percent figures , respectively , in those same categories against the Timberwolves in their most recent contest , and had also scored over 120 points in their two previous games . Cleveland was able to pull out the hard - fought victory on the back of LeBron James , who turned in a 37 - point , seven - rebound , nine - assist effort that also included a pair of steals . The other starters ' scoring contributions paled in comparison , as Kevin Love was the next closest with 15 points . However , Love was outstanding on the glass against a vulnerable Philadelphia frontcourt , hauling in 15 rebounds and adding seven assists and two steals . J.R. Smith added 14 points , three rebounds and a steal , and drained another four three - pointers in the process . Tristan Thompson had his own double - double in another start at center , collecting 10 points and grabbing 10 boards . Kyrie Irving had a second consecutive quiet game , notching eight points , five rebounds , two assists , two steals and a block over 31 minutes . Although his contributions in non - scoring categories were certainly solid , Irving notably struggled from the field , draining only three of 15 shot attempts . The Cavs improved to 26 - 9 and remain atop the Eastern Conference 's Central Division . They now head to Dallas to take on the Mavericks on Tuesday . Philadelphia 's valiant effort was spearheaded by Jahlil Okafor 's 21 points , which he supplemented with seven rebounds . Ish Smith put together a second straight strong performance after a string of relatively quiet games , tallying a double - double with 18 points and 10 assists . He also added seven boards and a steal . Jerami Grant and Nik Stauskas could only put together a pair of six - point outings , while Hollis Thompson paced the Philadephia bench with eight points and three rebounds . The Sixers fell to 4 - 36 and remain in last place in the Eastern Conference 's Atlantic Division . They await the Chicago Bulls for a Thursday matchup .
The Miami Heat ( 36 - 26 ) defeated the Philadelphia 76er ( 8 - 54 ) 112 - 102 on Friday . As they 've been prone to do on occasion this season , the Sixers give a considerably superior team trouble late into the game . The performance was even more surprising considering that it came on the road , and on a night where Philadelphia sported a depleted roster that was devoid of two of their most talented players . With Nerlens Noel ( knee ) and Jahlil Okafor ( shin ) sitting out , it was up to the likes of Ish Smith and Robert Covington to step up if Philadelphia was going to keep the game competitive . Both players answered the bell , tallying 26 and 25 points , respectively , which helped the Sixers impressively battle back from a 40 - 29 deficit after one quarter . Philadelphia even turned the tables on the Heat in the turnover department , doubling them up by eliciting 16 miscues from them while only committing eight themselves , less than half of their per - night average this season . Smith added eight rebounds , five assists and a steal to his team - leading point tally . Covington supplemented his scoring with five rebounds , three assists , a pair of steals and a block . Hollis Thompson drew the start at shooting guard , and contributed a solid 14 points , six rebounds , two assists , two steals and a block . Richaun Holmes , garnering some extra minutes off the bench with all of the injuries in the frontcourt , paced the reserves with 13 points , eight rebounds , two assists , a steal and a block . The Sixers remain in last place in the Eastern Conference 's Atlantic Division , and have the worst record in the league . They head down to Miami for the second game of the home - and - home series against the Heat on Sunday . The Heat likely planned to give a much more abbreviated allotment of minutes to their front - line players going in , but all five members of the first unit ended up playing sufficient time to tally double - digit scoring . Dwyane Wade led the field with 21 points , eight rebounds , four assists , three steals and a block . Hassan Whiteside paced the bench and was also the second - highest scorer on the team , tallying 19 points , 19 rebounds , two assists and two blocks over 34 minutes . Goran Dragic continued his recent stretch of outstanding play with a 15 - point , 11 - assist double - double that also included five rebounds and a steal . Luol Deng posted a near double - double , registering 13 points , hauling nine boards and dishing out a pair of assists . Joe Johnson and Amar'e Stoudemire rounded things out with a pair of 12 - point efforts , with the former adding two assists and two steals , and the latter posting four rebounds and a steal . Miami remains atop the Eastern Conference 's Southeast Division , and holds the fourth seed in the conference as well . They 're home on Sunday to face off in a return match with the Sixers .
The Oklahoma_City Thunder ( 47 - 22 ) defeated the Philadelpia 76ers ( 9 - 60 ) 111 - 97 on Friday . The Thunder could have easily been tempted to think a playoff spot was in the bag coming into Friday night , considering that all they needed to do was take care of business against an overmatched Sixers squad . However , as has been the case on several occasions this seasons , Philadelphia proved to be a tough out for a considerable portion of the game against a vastly superior opponent . The Sixers hung with the Thunder well into the third quarter , and did get a boost with the return of Jerami Grant ( concussion ) to the starting five . The hapless home squad also turned the tables on the visitors in the turnover department , eliciting 20 from the Thunder and commiting only eight themselves . Ultimately , however , Russell Westbrook 's league - leading 13th triple - double and Kevin Durant 's double - double were too much for the Sixers , and helped lead Oklahoma_City to victory . Durant finished with 26 points , 13 rebounds , six assists and a block , although he did account for a quarter of the turnovers for the Thunder . Westbrook was guilty of committing five miscues himself , but more than made up for it by supplying 20 points , 15 rebounds , 10 assists , two blocks and a steal . Steven Adams also tallied a double - double , which consisted of 12 points , 11 boards , three blocks and an assist . Enes Kanter paced the reserves with 16 points , seven rebounds and a block , although he handed the ball over to the opposition a team - high six times . The Thunder remain in first place in the Western Conference 's Northwest Division , and currently hold the third seed in the conference as well . They hit the road again for a date with the Indiana Pacers on Saturday night . The Sixers ' starters were led by Hollis Thompson 's 16 points , which he complemented with four rebounds , three assists and a pair of steals . Grant pitched in with 15 points , seven rebounds , two assists and three blocks . Nerlens Noel managed a near double - double with 12 points , nine boards , two assists , a steal and two blocks . Isaiah Canaan registered 10 points , four rebounds , two assists and three steals . Nik Stauskas paced the reserves - - and the team as a whole - - with 23 points , four rebounds , three assists and three steals over 34 minutes off the bench . The Sixers remain in last place in the Eastern Conference 's Atlantic Division with the worst record in the NBA . They 're home again Sunday for a date with the Boston Celtics .
The Boston Celtics ( 40 - 30 ) defeated the Philadelphia 76ers ( 9 - 61 ) 120 - 105 on Sunday . The Sixers are likely one of the best elixirs for a losing streak , and the Celtics were certainly in need of a victory coming into Sunday . They 'd lost four consecutive contests , and had seen their playoff seeding slip from third to sixth during that stretch . Ultimately , Boston was able to assert its superiority over their hapless hosts , but as has often been the case lately , it did n't happen without a fight from a feisty Sixers squad . Even after the Celtics jumped out to a 28 - 16 lead after one period , Philadelphia kept coming , and prevailed over the second and third quarters by a combined margin of 63 - 60 . Boston was able to pull away in the final 12 minutes however , and earned the rather hard - fought victory on the strength of solid shooting from all areas of the court . The Celtics managed a 49 percent success rate from the field , and 42 percent from three - point range.They were also strong down low , outrebounding the Sixers by a margin of 53 - 40 . Boston was unsurprisingly led by Isaiah Thomas , who compiled 26 points , eight assists , six rebounds and a steal . Avery Bradley was strong in support , tallying 20 points , four assists , three rebounds , four steals and a block . Amir Johnson was a pleasant surprise on offense , registering 18 points , eight rebounds and two blocks . Jared Sullinger and Evan Turner rounded out a successful night for the starting five with a pair of 17 - point efforts . The former also contributed 13 rebounds , an assist and a steal , while the latter registered nine rebounds and six assists . Marcus Smart paced the bench with 15 points , five rebounds , five assists and a pair of steals . The Celtics remain in second place in the Eastern Conference 's Atlantic Division , and have moved up to the fifth seed in the conference as well . They head back home to face the Orlando Magic on Monday night . The Sixers were spearheaded by an outstanding effort off the bench by Carl Landry , who amassed 26 points and eight rebounds over 25 highly efficient minutes . Hollis Thompson was next , checking in with 18 points , two assists , a rebound and a block . Ish Smith followed with 14 points , eight assists and three rebounds .

Forward Jerami Grant also contributed 21 points in what was an impressive night for the youngster . Both teams will close out what has been a disappointing season next week .
The Milwaukee Bucks ( 2 - 3 ) defeated the Philadelphia 76ers ( 0 - 4 ) by a score of 91 - 87 on Wednesday at the BMO Harris Bradley Center in Milwaukee Despite being the expected favorite coming in , the Bucks were n't able to get any sort of lead through the first three quarters , as time and again , the Sixers held strong .

Middleton was continually called upon for late - game heroics during the 2014 - 15 season , so Milwaukee was very happy to see the swingman return to form again Wednesday . Greg Monroe also was able to have success in this one , showing the young bigs of the Sixers his experience . Monroe finished with 18 points ( 7 - 14 FG , 4 - 5 FT ) , eight rebounds , and three steals over 36 minutes .

Okafor recorded 21 points ( 9 - 13 FG , 3 - 3 FT ) , six rebounds , and two blocked shots , while Noel finished with 17 points ( 8 - 16 FG , 1 - 2 FT ) , 12 rebounds , and one blocked shot . Noel has now notched three double - doubles over the first four games of the season , pushing his season averages to 12 points and 10 rebounds .

The Bucks shot nearly 50 percent from the field and 84 percent from the free - throw line while holding the Magic to just 41 percent shooting .

Cleveland shot 55 percent from the field , 90 percent from the free - throw line and 50 percent from three - point range . They also held the Bucks to under 40 percent shooting .

The win helped the Bulls improve to 7 - 1 at home this season and moved them into a tie with the Pacers for second place in the Eastern Conference standings . The Nuggets managed to take a four - point lead into the fourth quarter after a 13 - 3 run to end the third , but Gasol was just too much in the final frame . Denver had an awful night shooting from the field , hitting 35 - of - 90 and got absolutely no production from any guards , who combined to score 11 points . Emmanuel Mudiay had the worst night with just four points on 2 - of - 12 shooting , though he did dish out seven assists .

Faried scored 14 points ( 7 - 10 FG , 0 - 2 FT ) with eight rebounds and three assists over 28 minutes . The Bulls came away with the win , but lost a key contributor in the process after Nikola Mirotic was elbowed in the face in the first period and did not return . Mirotic played just five minutes before leaving , hitting a lone 3 - pointer to go along with three rebounds and a steal . With Mirotic gone for the game , coach Fred Hoiberg turned to Joakim Noah , who has looked more like his old self lately .

Chicago returns to action Saturday in the third game of a four - game homestand against the Hornets ; the Nuggets play the fourth of a five - game road trip Thursday against the Raptors .
The Chicago Bulls ( 17 - 12 ) came up with a big 104 - 97 home win , over the Toronto Raptors ( 19 - 13 ) , Monday night . This was the two teams first match of the season .

The Toronto Raptors came out strong , with a 32 - 23 first quarter . The Bulls then came to life and out - scored the Raptors 81 - 65 the rest of the way , snapping the Raptors short , two - game win streak . Kyle Lowry led the Raptors with a strong 28 - point ( 9 - 15 FG , 3 - 4 3Pt , 7 - 8 FT ) , nine assist , six rebound and three steal performance , in 40 minutes . DeMar DeRozan was also solid , coming close to a triple - double , with 19 points ( 7 - 14 FG , 5 - 8 FT ) , eight rebounds and eight assists , in 35 minutes . DeMarre Carroll was back in the starting lineup after coming off the bench in his first game back from injury .

The sliding Chicago Bulls ( 28 - 26 ) bounced back for a 116 - 106 win over the red - hot Toronto Raptors ( 35 - 18 ) on Friday night . Chicago , still without star guard Jimmy Butler ( knee ) , has fallen in the Eastern Conference standings . Once rivaling Cleveland for top of the conference , Chicago started February 1 - 6 and remains at risk for losing a playoff spot . Friday 's win certainly helps the Bulls ' case , however , as they were able to upend the dominant Toronto Raptors . Sophomore Doug McDermott came up big for the Bulls , scoring a career - high 30 points on 13 - for - 17 shooting . `` McBuckets '' played big minutes due to the absence of Chicago 's All-Star wing , and he did not crack under the pressure . The Creighton alumni did not turn over the ball in 31 minutes of play . Former MVP Derrick Rose continued his hot start to 2016 , pouring in 26 points on solid 12 - for - 20 shooting . The Raptors came into the All-Star break as one of the NBA 's hottest teams , but faltered in Chicago on Friday . While every starter reached double - digits , their bench combined for just nine points with no backup contributing more than two . The second unit went a combined 4 - for - 15 in what was a disastrous bench performance from the Raps . The starters , however , came up big for Toronto , with Kyle Lowry , Jonas Valanciunas , and DeMar DeRozan posting 27 , 25 , and 22 respectively . Valanciunas added 12 rebounds for one of his biggest nights of the season . Both teams will host Western Conference opponents on Sunday . Chicago will host the struggling Lakers , while the Raptors are scheduled to take on the Memphis Grizzlies .
The Chicago Bulls ( 42 - 40 ) defeated the Philadelphia 76ers ( 10 - 72 ) in the season finale Wednesday night at United Center , 115 - 105 . Philadelphia exploded out of the gate , scoring 32 points in the first quarter and 60 poitns in the first half , enough to take a nine - point lead into the break . But the 76ers offense completely collapsed in the third quarter , as Philadelphia notched just 13 points in the frame and saw their nine - point lead turn into a 13 - point deficit , a big enough swing for the Bulls to coast to the finish line . The three - pointers were flying all day in this one , as the two teams combined to make 32 of their 59 attempts , a ridiculous 54 shooting percentage from downtown for the two squads . Nikola Mirotic knocked down seven three - pointers en route to a 32 - point night to lead all scorers . Jrue Holiday hit five threes of his own and finished with 29 points , and Jimmy Butler notched a triple - double with 10 points , 12 rebounds , and 10 assists . Chicago shot just 42 percent from inside the arc but made 15 of their 24 three - pionters ( 63 percent ) , a relentless barrage that inevitably sunk the 76ers . Robert Covington led the 76ers with six three - poinit makes and 27 points . Jerian Grant finished with 20 points ( 7 - 14 FG , 2 - 4 3PT , 4 - 6 FT ) and Hollis Thompson came off the bench to add 21 points ( 8 - 13 FG , 3 - 6 3PT , 2 - 3 FT ) . The 76ers shot well from three - point land ( 17 - 35 , 49 percent ) but were destroyed on the glass , as they managed just four offensive rebounds and were outrebounded overall 53 - 31 . Both clubs have been eliminated from postseason contention .
The Cavaliers ( 19 - 7 ) held off the Knicks ( 14 - 16 ) for a 91 - 84 victory at Quicken Loans Arena on Wednesday . The Knicks fought tough , but were unable to handle the Cavaliers stifling defense , particularly in the fourth quarter in which New_York managed just 12 points . Iman Shumpert did an excellent job defending locking down Aaron Afflalo , while LeBron James and Kevin Love each poured in 23 points . Cleveland padded its lead in the Eastern Conference standings with a sixth straight win - - the Cavaliers longest winning streak of the season was eight games earlier in the season . It was a solid effort from the Knicks without All-Star forward Carmelo Anthony , who was sidelined due to an ankle injury , thought he was expected to play earlier in the day after shootaround . In Anthony 's stead , New_York turned to rookie Kristaps Porzingus , who poured in a team - high 23 points on 8 - of - 18 shooting to go along with 13 rebounds . It was a nice bounce - back game for Porzingus , as the young big man had n't scored more than 20 points since Dec. 7 against the Mavericks . He also set a new career high with four 3 - pointers made . The Cavaliers received a big boost with Kyrie Irving returning to the lineup Sunday against the 76ers , but the superstar point guard has n't been very effective . He played just 19 minutes Wednesday and was limited to five points on 1 - of - 7 shooting from the field . It 's still only been two games since Irving 's return , so chances are he 'll need a few more contests to get back into the swing of things , which the Cavaliers can certainly afford considering how well they 've played lately . Tristan Thompson posted his fifth double - double of the season with 10 points and 14 rebounds .
The Cleveland Cavaliers ( 23 - 9 ) defeated the Toronto Raptors ( 21 - 15 ) 122 - 100 on Monday . Already known for their suffocating defense , the Cavaliers flipped the switch on another aspect of their game Monday , one that should put the rest of the league on notice . Cleveland caught fire from the field and turned into Warriors East for the evening , knocking down 55 percent of their attempts from the field and an outstanding 52 percent of the 33 they took from beyond the arc . The Cavs ' starting five impressively drained 13 long - range buckets , with the reserves pitching in another four . Their sharpshooting resulted in a season - high 122 points for Cleveland , who pulled away from the Raptors in the second half by winning the final two quarters by a pair of 32 - 22 margins . The visitors were led by Kyle Lowry 's 23 - point , 10 - assist double - double , his third straight such performance . He supplemented the effort with four rebounds , a pair of steals and a block . Partner in crime and backcourt mate DeMar DeRozan was right behind Lowry with 19 points , four assists , a pair of rebounds and a steal . The remaining members of the starting five managed modest - to - subpar efforts , with Jonas Valanciunas ' nine points and eight rebounds serving as the most notable . Patrick Patterson paced the Raptors bench with 15 points . Toronto fell to 21 - 15 but remains in first place in the Eastern Conference 's Atlantic Division . They now head to Brooklyn to take on the Nets on Wednesday . Cleveland 's formidable attack was spearheaded by Kyrie Irving , who can be officially considered back to full strength . The 23 - year - old played a season - high 29 minutes and was highly productive with them , pouring in a season - best 25 points , dishing out eight assists and hauling in six boards . J.R. Smith pitched in with a 24 - point effort that consisted exclusively of three - pointers , while LeBron James managed 20 points , seven assists , a pair of rebounds and three steals . Kevin Love and Tristan Thompson rounded out a stellar night for the starters with a pair of 14 - point efforts , totals that were complemented with nine and 11 rebounds , respectively .

They now head to Washington to take on the Wizards on Wednesday .
The Cleveland Cavaliers ( 31 - 12 ) held on Wednesday night to defeat the Minnesota Timberwolves ( 14 - 32 ) at Quicken Loans Arena , 114 - 107 . The Cavaliers took an eight - point lead into the fourth quarter and led by as many as 15 in the final frame , but a furious comeback effort by the Wolves closed the gap to 94 - 91 with just 6:5 to go . The Cavaliers responded with a 70 run that seemed like it would ice the game for sure , but another run from the Timberwolves closed the gap to 110 - 107 with just 16 seconds to play . A pair of LeBron James free throws and two missed three - pointers by the Wolves on the other end finally sealed the win for Cleveland . James finished with 25 points to lead the Cavaliers on a brutally efficient 11 - 15 shooting night . He completed his offensive dominance with a game - high nine assists , and he added four rebounds , a steal and a block . Tristan Thompson was a wrecking ball inside , as he scored 19 points on 8 - 10 shooting and pulled down 12 rebounds ( seven offensive ) . Matthew Dellevadova scored 18 as he knocked down four three - pointers , and he added seven assists to serve as a spark off the bench . Karl-Anthony Towns was fantastic in the losing effort , as he scored 26 points on 11 - 16 shooting and grabbed 11 rebounds for his third double - double in the past four contests . Andrew Wiggins added 20 and Zach Lavine came off the bench with an electric 21 points , six assists and four rebounds . The Wolves just could n't get anything going from the three - point line - - 4 - 16 compared to Cleveland 's 11 - 31 - - and that proved to be the difference . Minnesota will return home to face the Oklahoma City Thunder on Wednesday . Cleveland continues their homestand Wednesday against Phoenix .

Cleveland shot a whopping 56 percent from the field while sinking 11 three - pointers and simultaneously forcing 22 Phoenix turnovers . The team recorded an impressive 34 total assists , including nine from star LeBron James . In addition to his role as distributor , LeBron scored a highly efficient 21 points on 7 for 8 shooting from the field and 7 of 7 at the line . Power forward Kevin Love , who has been the subject of many trade rumors of late , also posted 21 points along with 11 rebounds , four assists , two steals , and two blocks . Phoenix has been struggling mightily lately , winning just two of its last 19 games . With star point guard Eric Bledsoe out for the season due to a torn meniscus , the Suns have given the reigns to their young core of players . Rookie Devin Booker has shone in a starting role , and Wednesday was no exception . Booker posted 16 points , three rebounds , and five assists , and turned the ball over just twice in 34 minutes . The Suns will have a day off before traveling to Madison Square Garden to take on the Knicks on Friday night . The Cavs , meanwhile , visit Central-Division foe Detroit on Friday .

Boston will host Sacramento on Sunday afternoon . The Cavs , meanwhile , face the New Orleans Pelicans on Saturday .
The Cleveland Cavaliers ( 38 - 14 ) defeated the Los_Angeles Lakers ( 11 - 44 ) 120 - 111 on Wednesday . The new - look Cavaliers are certainly playing up in pace under new coach Tyronn Lue , but an unintended consequence of their more prolific offense has been increased vulnerability on defense . Cleveland has been giving opposing teams extra possessions under their more aggressive style , resulting in some uncharacteristic shootouts in recent games that have them looking a bit like Warriors East . Such was the case Wednesday , with the Lakers managing one of their best scoring hauls of the season . Both teams shot well from the field and behind the arc , but the Cavs were just a tad more effective and also took better care of the ball . Cleveland was guilty of only seven turnovers on the night , as compared to 11 for Los_Angeles . The home squad also managed 51 percent accuracy from the field overall and 42 percent from three - point range , while the Lakers posted respective 44 and 46 percent tallies in those categories .

The shorthanded Memphis Grizzlies ( 38 - 25 ) shocked the Cleveland Cavaliers ( 44 - 18 ) in a 106 - 103 win on Monday . Memphis was projected to lose by 10 with all their regulars , but won this game with all those players sitting . That spread skyrocketed to 15 points once it was announced that Memphis would be without Zach Randolph , Marc Gasol , Mike Conley and Matt Barnes for this game . The backups somehow pulled out a miraculous win , thanks to forcing the Cavaliers to commit 25 turnovers , while committing just 16 of their own . Memphis started off hot , as they scored 33 points in the first quarter to take an eight - point lead . Memphis got some heroic performances tonight in a showcase win . Tony Allen was especially good , as he tallied 26 points , four assists and five steals in the win for the third - highest point total of his career .

Kyrie Irving also played well , as he amassed 28 points , five assists and four steals . The Cavaliers start a four - game West Coast trip on Wednesday against the Sacramento Kings in their next matchup .
The Cleveland Cavaliers ( 50 - 20 ) defeated the Denver Nuggets ( 29 - 42 ) 124 - 91 on Monday . Even without Kevin Love ( illness ) , the Cavs had no trouble exerting their will on a considerably inferior Nuggets squad , and clinching a division title in the process . LeBron James had been fairly quiet in recent games by his standards , but stepped up his role in the offense without Love in the lineup . LeBron managed his second triple - double of the season , posting 33 points , eleven rebounds and eleven assists . Cleveland outperformed Denver in every major category , and played an outstanding defensive game overall . They also managed a 56 percent success rate from the field , and a 48 percent figure from three - point range . The Nuggets were paced by a spectacular effort off the bench from Will Barton , who managed 27 points , four rebounds , an assist and a pair of steals . Nikola Jokic and Gary Harris led the starters , but it was only with a pair of 11 - point efforts . The former also added four rebounds , three assists and three steals , while the latter managed a pair of rebounds , an assist and a pair of steals . No other member of the first unit tallied double - digit points , but Jusuf Nurkic did pitch in with 11 points , seven rebounds , three assists , a steal and three blocks in 26 minutes off the bench .

With Kyrie Irving sitting out with an injured ankle , James led the way for Cleveland with a game - high 31 points , and added 12 assists , eight rebounds and a pair of steals . He was far from the only contributor however , as J.R. Smith and Kevin Love also notably stepped up in the absence of their All-Star point guard . The victory helped the Cavs open up a 4 - game lead over the idle Toronto Raptors for the top seed in the Eastern Conference with five games to play . Cleveland will have to keep their knife sharpened for at least a couple of more contests , as their remaining games include four opponents who will be fighting for playoff position .

The Brooklyn Nets ( 10 - 23 ) defeated the Boston Celtics ( 18 - 15 ) 100 - 97 on Saturday . Brooklyn , which had only three road victories this season , got a rare road win against the Celtics . The Nets largely accomplished their unlikely feat by going through the weak spot of the Celtics ' otherwise formidable defense , the frontcourt . As has often been the case this season , Brook Lopez and Thaddeus Young dominated down low with a pair of double - double efforts . Lopez led all scorers with a season - high 30 points , and added 13 rebounds , two assists , a steal and a block for his sixth double - double in the last seven games . Meanwhile , Young contributed 16 points , 10 boards , an assist and a steal . The Nets impressively scored almost half of their points in the paint , collecting 46 near the basket on the afternoon , and also hauled in 50 rebounds . While Boston matched them in scoring down low and actually bested them by one board in the latter category , Lopez 's mammoth offensive showing played an integral role in allowing Brooklyn to escape with a hard - fought victory . Veteran Joe Johnson was the third Brooklyn starter to turn in a notable effort , posting 20 points on 9 of 19 shooting . It was somewhat of a breakout game for the 15 - year veteran , who had not eclipsed the 20 - point mark since Dec. 8 against the Rockets , and who was also coming off three straight single - digit scoring outings . Bojan Bogdanovic contributed a solid 13 points and six rebounds , while Jarrett Jack , who was only able to muster two points but who did dish out nine assists , exited the game late in the third quarter with what is believed to be a right knee sprain at a minimum . Jack 's right leg appeared to buckle on a fast break opportunity , and the Nets will hold out hope for the best with respect to their veteran point guard . The Nets improved to 10 - 23 but remain in fourth place in the Eastern Conference 's Atlantic Division . They now head home to face this same Celtics squad Monday in the second game of the teams ' home - and - home series . The Celtics struggled to find the basket all afternoon , particularly from long range . They could only manage 39 and 22 percent metrics , respectively , from the field and beyond the arc . Isaiah Thomas did lead the way with a solid 24 points , six assists , two rebounds and two steals over 36 minutes , and shot a respectable 10 - for - 22 . However , Thomas could only drain two of the nine three - point shots he attempted , and missed a 27 - footer with 14 seconds left that would have closed the Boston deficit to three at the time . The dependable Jae Crowder did pick up a technical for a scuffle with Jack , but also put up 16 points and hauled in seven boards . He also handed out three assists and recorded a pair of steals . While the other three starters could only muster single - digit scoring , Amir Johnson did supplement his seven points with 11 rebounds . Evan Turner and Marcus Smart paced the Boston reserves , who scored 41 as a group , with 12 and 11 points , respectively . Turner added seven rebounds and three assists , while Smart pitched in with three boards , an assist and three steals . Two of Smart 's thefts came in the final 19 seconds , but the Celtics were only able to convert those into two points in the form of a Turner field goal off the rebound of Thomas ' aforementioned three - point miss . Boston fell to 18 - 15 but remains in second place in the Eastern Conference 's Atlantic Division . They hit the road to for another go - around with the Nets at the Barclays Center on Monday .

The Celtics scored the game 's final 12 points to foil a Pacers comeback attempt . Thomas scored a game - high 28 points behind a sharp 4 - 6 three - point shooting night , and he added four rebounds and three assists . Jae Crowder poured in 25 on a ruthlessly efficient 11 - 15 shooting night as he added three three - pointers of his own . The Celtics were spreading the ball around , as they recorded assists on 24 of their 40 made baskets and had four players with at least three dimes . Paul George led the Pacers with 23 points , but he shot a poor 7 - 20 from the floor and turned the ball over five times . Ian Mahinmi mustered a double - double with 10 points and 10 rebounds . The Pacers just could n't overcome their poor shooting , though , as they shot a brutal 5 - 30 from the three - point line ( 17 percent ) , including an 0 - 9 night from C.J. Miles . The Pacers have lost two of three and will look to turn it around Friday at home against Washington . Boston snapped a four - game losing streak and will continue a homestand against the Suns .

Boston scored 46 points in a frantic first quarter and was brilliant offensively all day , as they shot a sharp 56 percent from the field and 55 percent from three . Boston 's starting backcourt powered the Celtics offense , as Avery Bradley led the team with 25 points ( 9 - 16 FG , 6 - 7 3PT ) and Isaiah Thomas ( 8 - 18 FG ) added 22 . Jared Sullinger ( 10 - 13 FG , 21 points ) and Tyler Zeller ( 6 - 8 FG , 17 points ) gave Boston an efficient inside attack as well . DeMarcus Cousins led the Kings with a game - high 31 points and added seven rebounds and six assists . Rajon Rondo scored 14 points and dished 15 assists and Willie Cauley-Stein scored 15 behind sharp 7 - 9 shooting from the field .

Sacramento 's road trip continues Monday against Cleveland .
The Boston Celtics ( 39 - 27 ) took care of the shorthanded Memphis Grizzlies ( 38 - 26 ) in a 116 - 96 win on Wednesday . This game appeared to be lopsided on paper and that proved to be the case on the floor . The Celtics really took it to the Grizzlies in the second half , as they outscored them 64 - 4`.The key for Boston was the defense , as they held Memphis to 38 percent shooting and drew 19 turnovers in the win . Memphis won their last game against the Cleveland Cavaliers in a similar circumstance , but this was the result that was much more likely with such a limited roster . Once again , Mike Conley , Zach Randolph and Marc Gasol missed this game and it clearly hampered the Grizzlies . JaMychal Green got the start for Randolph and double - doubled in a 17 - point , 13 - rebound performance . Jarrell Martin and Vince Carter both played well off the bench , as they went for 33 points combined , despite much of that coming in garbage time .

The Los_Angeles Clippers ( 9 - 8 ) defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves ( 8 - 9 ) 107 - 99 on Sunday . The Clippers led by 11 at the half and it never got much closer than that . Los_Angeles did a great job of keeping a six - to - eight point distance from the T'Wolves throughout the second half to hold them off for a much needed win . Both teams shot well in this matchup , as Minnesota shot 45 percent while Los_Angeles shot 52 percent . The Clippers starters outscored the Wolves starters 80 - 58 and that proved to be the difference in the game . Minnesota was 6 - 2 on the road coming into this game , but were unable to add to that impressive record . Minnesota had six players score in double - digits , but the problem was that the other five players combined for just eight points , with three of them going scoreless . The T-Wolves were led by Andrew Wiggins once again who dropped 21 points . Zach LaVine also had a nice game filling - in for Ricky Rubio , as he tallied 18 points and seven assists in the defeat . Karl-Anthony Towns was having a very good game through three quarters , but he barely played in the fourth for an unknown reason . Minnesota will take on the Orlando Magic in their next fixture on Tuesday . The Clippers had lost eight of 11 games before their win over the New Orleans Pelicans on Friday , so this added to that to start a modest two - game winning streak . Los_Angeles got some much needed momentum here , as they are far too talented to be hovering around .500 . They were extremely efficient today as a team , as they shot 52 percent and assisted 24 times on 39 baskets . The team was led by a near triple - double from Blake Griffin , who collected 26 points , eight rebounds and eight assists in the win . They also got 20 points and nine assists from Chris Paul and these two will need to play like this going forward if they want to dig out of this hole .

The Los_Angeles Clippers ( 22 - 13 ) throttled the Philadelphia 76ers ( 3 - 33 ) 130 - 99 on Saturday night to extend their season - long winning streak . This looked like a mismatch on paper and that proved to be the case on the court . The Clippers scored at least 27 points in every quarter and took a 29 - point lead into the fourth . They shot an incredible 61 percent from the field in the win and had far too many easy buckets . The starters were also a huge difference , as the Los_Angeles starters amassed 72 points while the Sixers starters could only muster up 34 points . Philadelphia came into this game as huge underdogs in the second half of a back - to - back and it was clear they didn’t have it tonight . If that doesn’t make it hard enough , their 3 - 33 record does . They have been playing much more competitive lately , but this game was just one of those road blowouts that has become all too common with this team . Ish Smith led the team with 10 assists and Jahlil Okafor had a nice game off the bench . Okafor tallied 23 points and four rebounds in just 18 minutes of action . The Sixers will take on a fellow lottery contender on Monday when they play the Minnesota Timberwolves in their next game . The Clippers set a season - high tonight with their sixth - straight win and did it in dominating fashion . The starters were actually allowed to sit the final quarter and they could have had monster games if they got a full complement of minutes . Chris Paul and DeAndre Jordan were still able to record double - doubles in just three quarters . Paul totaled 15 points and 14 assists , while Jordan provided 22 points and 13 rebounds . Austin Rivers scored a team - high 26 points , with most of that coming in garbage time It 's strange to see this team finally clicking after the injury to Blake Griffin , but they ca n't be any worse when he returns in a few weeks . The Clippers will have some time off until they play the Portland Trail Blazers on Wednesday in their next game .
The Los_Angeles Clippers ( 52 - 28 ) defeated the Dallas Mavericks ( 41 - 39 ) Sunday afternoon at Staples Center , 98 - 91 .

Charlotte has been impressive on offense throughout their first 21 contests , coming into Friday as a top 10 - ranked unit with an average of 102 points scored per game . An integral component of their success has been the play of stalwart point guard Kemba Walker and offseason acquisition Nicolas Batum , with the latter making a considerable impact in a Hornets uniform now that he 's fully recovered from the wrist problems that plagued him throughout his final campaign in Portland . The Dynamic Duo were at it again Friday , with Walker managing 33 points , his third outing with 30 or more on the season . The 25 - year - old added six assists and five rebounds in a dynamic performance . Meanwhile , Batum bounced back from two modest efforts to post 20 points , four rebounds and a pair of assists .

Paul George led all scorers with 29 points , in addition to six rebounds and two assists on 8 - of - 22 shooting . George’s 26 points per game ( prior to Saturday’s performance ) ranked fifth in the league and he has also seen success from the 3 - point line , save for tonight , as he finished 4 - of - 12 from deep . Monta Ellis added 13 points , two rebounds and an assist , while Jordan Hill provided 10 points and 13 rebounds off the bench . Both players shot 50 percent from the field , although the team shot 39 percent and a rough 18 percent with from 3 - point territory . C.J. Miles failed to get any sort of rhythm going and finished with zero points on 0 - of - 9 shooting .

Memphis didn’t panic , exploding for 16 points in the extra session to pull away from the scrappy visitors .

Avery Bradley returned for Boston after missing the past three - plus games with a hip injury , and was immediately reinserted into the starting lineup .

The 25 - year - old managed 14 points , two rebounds and two steals over a robust 38 minutes , but notably came up empty with respect to his trademark three - pointers . His third and final missed attempt of the night from beyond the arc was the most crucial , as Bradley failed to drain a 26 - foot three - point jumper at the buzzer that would have sent the contest into overtime .

As has been the case recently , it was a backup that spearheaded Memphis ' offensive charge , as Zach Randolph took advantage of the Celtics ' vulnerable frontcourt with a 25 - point , 13 - rebound double - double that also included a pair of assists , a steal and a pair of blocks . It was the 15 - year veteran 's third performance of over 20 points in the last four games , and his second double - double over that span , with Randolph having come off the bench in all of those contests . Mario Chalmers was next in line with an outstanding 18 - point , five - rebound , four - assist performance in Conley 's stead that included an 11 - for - 13 tally from the free - throw line . Four of those buckets from the charity stripe came in the fourth quarter , when the Grizzlies managed to overcome the 76 - 68 deficit they 'd entered the period with . Tony Allen was also highly efficient in his second start in place of Lee , posting a 15 - point , 10 - rebound double - double that also included a pair of steals and a block . Not to be outdone , Marc Gasol poured in 11 points and hauled in 11 boards , with almost half his scoring haul ( five points ) coming during the Grizzlies ' comeback in the final period .

Memphis improved to 21 - 18 and currently resides in third place in the Western Conference 's Southwest Division . They await the Houston Rockets for an intra - divisional showdown on Tuesday .

The Knicks came into this game hot , but they simply couldn’t muster up enough offense late to prevail with a big road win . The offensive struggles have to be taken into context though , as the Knicks were without All-Star Carmelo Anthony for this game . Kristaps Porzingis stepped up in Anthony 's absence , by tallying 17 points , four rebounds , two assists and two steals in the loss . Langston Galloway got his first start of the season and played very well , as he scored 11 points to go along with 11 rebounds and five assists .

Brooklyn will visit Toronto on Monday . The Hawks , meanwhile , will be visited by the Orlando Magic on Monday .
The Atlanta Hawks ( 28 - 22 ) defeated the Dallas Mavericks ( 28 - 23 ) 112 - 97 on Monday . The subject of trade rumors and victim to a notable slump for most of January , Jeff Teague 's 2016 had n't exactly gotten off to the best of starts . However , the 27 - year - old point guard had slowly begun crawling his way back to prominence over the four games prior to Monday , averaging a solid 16 points per contest during that span . Monday 's matchup against a Mavericks defense that had struggled against point guards this season proved to be the final domino to fall in Teague 's resurgence , as he managed a season - high 32 points , and complemented them with eight assists , five rebounds and a steal over 28 highly efficient minutes . Having totaled a modest 12 points in the first half as Atlanta built a 53 - 46 lead , Teague tallied 13 points in the third quarter alone , helping the home team emerge from the period with a commanding 86 - 73 lead they would n't surrender .

Zaza Pachulia could only pitch in four points , but did haul in 13 boards . The Mavericks remain in third place in the Western Conference 's Southwest Division . They head home for a date with the Miami Heat on Wednesday . Teague 's prolific night was seconded by a 16 - point contribution from Kyle Korver , who also posted three assists , two rebounds and a block . The sharpshooting two - guard 's performance was a notable departure from his previous pair of contests , when he 'd managed six points against the Pacers and then was held scoreless versus the Heat . Dennis Schroder made it a successful night for the Hawks point guards by collecting 14 points , three rebounds , three assists and a steal off the bench in just 16 minutes of action . Paul Millsap had a rare quiet night on the scoreboard with only eight points , but did manage to pull down 12 rebounds , dish out two assists and record two blocks .

The Miami Heat ( 11 - 6 ) edged the Oklahoma_City Thunder ( 11 - 8 ) 97 - 95 Thursday . The Heat utilized outstanding ball movement and another vintage performance from Dwyane Wade to stay a step ahead of the high - octane Thunder from the second quarter onward . Miami amassed a total of 25 assists while Wade posted his second outstanding performance over the last four days . After a season - high 30 point effort versus the Celtics Monday , the perennial All-Star provided a game - high 28 - point encore , and added four rebounds , four assists and a steal .

The offensive linchpins posted a pair of 25 - point efforts , with Westbrook adding seven assists , five rebounds and a steal , and Durant complementing his scoring with nine boards and five dimes .

Serge Ibaka and Steven Adams contributed a pair of nine - point efforts and added seven and eight boards , respectively . Andre Roberson could n't help on the scoreboard with only two points , but did haul in nine rebounds . Overall , the Thunder controlled the glass , outrebounding the Heat 44 to 35 in the contest .

The Miami Heat ( 19 - 13 ) defeated the Dallas Mavericks ( 19 - 14 ) 106 - 82 on Friday . Perennial All-Star Dwyane Wade was not expected to play after experiencing flu - like symptoms Friday afternoon . However , the veteran decided to tough things out and remain active in a reserve role , in an effort to help the Heat put a halt to a recent cold spell that had seen them lose three of their last five contests . The move paid off , as the 33 - year - old collected 10 points , seven assists , two rebounds and a steal over just 19 minutes off the bench . Miami was able to dominate the contest with outstanding shooting and highly productive performances from their starters as well , as they tallied an impressive 56 shooting percentage from the field , and a solid 44 percent from beyond the arc . Meanwhile , their suffocating defense stymied Dallas to the tune of 36 and 23 percent tallies , respectively , in those categories . As evidenced by the final score and the aforementioned team shooting figures , the Mavericks obviously had significant trouble making a dent on the scoreboard , and their top scorer netted only 14 points . That player was surprisingly Zaza Pachulia , who did also add 13 rebounds , an assist , a steal and a block . Wesley Matthews ( 12 points , four rebounds and an assist ) and Dirk Nowitzki ( 11 points , three rebounds , an assist and a steal ) were the only other starters in double figures points - wise , while Charlie Villanueva and Deron Williams led the reserves with a pair of nine - point efforts . J.J. Barea , drawing the start for Williams , could only contribute six points and five assists . Dallas dropped to 19 - 14 and currently resides in second place in the Western Conference 's Southwest Division . They head home to face the New Orleans Pelicans on Saturday . The Heat 's starting five was spearheaded by a monster double - double from Hassan Whiteside that was reminscent of many of his dominant performances from his breakout 2014 - 15 campaign . The four - year pro managed 25 points and a season - high 19 rebounds , along with a block . Chris Bosh poured in 16 points and added seven rebounds and four assists , while Goran Dragic continued his recent stretch of solid offensive play with 15 points , seven assists , four rebounds and three steals . In addition to Wade 's strong performance off the bench , Gerald Green made a splash with a 19 - point , three - rebound , two - assist effort over 33 minutes that paced the Miami reserves . While Tyler Johnson ( eight points , three rebounds ) drew the start in Wade 's stead , Green got hot from the field and received some extra run as a result . The Heat improved to 19 - 13 and have vaulted into second place in the Eastern Conference 's Southeast Division by virtue of their victory and the Magic 's loss to the Wizards earlier in the evening . They now hit the road to face off against the Wizards on Sunday .
The Miami Heat ( 34 - 26 ) defeated the Chicago Bulls ( 30 - 29 ) 129 - 111 on Tuesday . It 's often said that a change of scenery can do wonders for a player 's outlook and consequently , his performance . Such appears to be the case with Miami 's latest acquisition , 15 - year veteran Joe Johnson . In just his second game in a Heat uniform , Johnson paced the starting unit with 24 points , and added five rebounds , four assists and a block , his second performance of 20 points or more in two games in South Florida . He was an integral part of a historic shooting performance for the home squad , which tallied a 68 percent success rate from the field , including 50 percent from beyond the arc . Not only was it the top team shooting night to date in the 2015 - 16 campaign , but also the 17th - best such effort in the last 50 seasons . The 129 points also represented Miami 's highest scoring tally of the season . Lost in the Heat 's offense 's coming - out party was a pretty fair showing on the scoreboard by the Bulls . Seven Chicago players - - four starters and three reserves - - managed double - digit scoring , led by Derrick Rose 's 17 points . He added three assists and a steal , in his first game back from the hamstring ailment that had caused him to miss the three previous contests . Aaron Brooks followed with a 16 - point performance that paced the Bulls ' bench , and that also included a pair of rebounds and an assist . Pau Gasol was next with a near double - double , registering 15 points , nine boards , six assists and a block . Taj Gibson supplied 13 points , three rebounds , an assist and a steal , while Mike Dunleavy amassed 10 points , two rebounds and an assist . Bobby Portis and Doug McDermott were the other two reserves with double - digit scoring , as they each contributed 11 points . The former also brought down seven boards and recored four steals , while the latter complemented his scoring total with a rebound , an assist and a steal . The Bulls are in third place in the Eastern Conference 's Central Division , and dropped a half - game back of the now eighth - seeded Detroit Pistons with the loss . They head up the road to Orlando for an encounter with the Magic on Wednesday night . With such a prolific showing , the Heat naturally had plenty to be pleased about on the stat sheet . Hassan Whiteside continued to show that perhaps coming off the bench is what best suits him , as he once again paced Miami with a 26 - point , 14 - rebound effort that also included an assist and four blocks . It was notably the sixth straight double - double in his six post - All - Star - break games , all in a reserve role . Johnson was next with his aforementioned 24 - point haul , and he also posted five rebounds , four assists and a block . Luol Deng continued his solid stretch of play , totaling 20 points , four rebounds , two assists and a steal . Dwyane Wade was next in line with 18 points , seven assists and a pair of rebounds , and Goran Dragic was right behind with a 17 - point , 11 - assist double - double that was supplemented with four boards and a steal . Miami sits atop the Eastern Conference 's Southeastern Division , and currently has a hold on the fourth seed in the conference as well . They remain home to face the Phoenix Suns on Thursday .
The Charlotte Hornets ( 7 - 6 ) handled the Philadelphia 76ers ( 0 - 13 ) 113 - 88 on Friday . These were two teams going in opposite directions coming into Friday 's game and that fact ended up playing out on the court yet again . It was a 21 - point game at the half and the Sixers couldn’t really recover after that poor start . The biggest discrepancies in the game were the free - throw shooting and turnovers . Charlotte made 21 - of - 22 free - throws while the Sixers went just 16 - for - 22 and the Hornets won the turnover battle 17 - 11 . It was already ugly for the Sixers , but it 's getting down right atrocious at this point . What 's really hurting this team is their offense , as they rank dead - last in the NBA in scoring and lowered that average here . Philadelphia opted to go with a smaller lineup by bringing Nerlens Noel off the bench , which is a strange move considering he 's arguably their best player . He still played 27 minutes and tallied 16 points and nine rebounds in the loss . The best player for the Sixers on this night was Nik Stauskas , who totaled 15 points , three assists and two rebounds in the defeat . Philadelphia will look to grab that first elusive win in Miami on Saturday against the Heat . The Hornets are quietly one of the hottest teams in the NBA right now , as they have won seven of their last 10 games . Much of that success can be credited to Nicolas Batum , but it was the mainstay combo of Kemba Walker and Al Jefferson who got it done on Friday night . Walker tallied 20 points and seven assists while Jefferson collected 26 points , 10 rebounds and five blocks in the win . Rookie Frank Kaminsky also had his best game in his short career , contributing nine points , three rebounds and three assists in the victory . This is a dangerous team in the East going forward and they look like a threat to make the playoffs and possibly win a game in the postseason for the first time in 14 years . They 'll look to keep up this form against the Sacramento Kings on Monday .
The Hornets ( 8 - 6 ) mounted a huge comeback to defeat the Kings ( 5 - 10 ) 127 - 122 in overtime at Time Warner Cable Arena on Monday . After trailing by 17 points after the third quarter , the Hornets stormed back by outscoring the Kings 38 - 21 in the fourth quarter . Kemba Walker led the way for Charlotte with a season - and game - high 39 points ( 16 - 23 FG , 4 - 6 3Pt , 3 - 4 FT ) , including the go - ahead basket late in the fourth that nearly won the game had it not been for Rudy Gay 's game - tying alley - oop off an inbounds play with 1 seconds remaining . As if the loss was n't bad enough , the Kings lost DeMarcus Cousins in overtime due to a stiff back . He finished with a team - high 30 points ( 13 - 21 FG , 2 - 6 3Pt , 2 - 4 FT ) and 11 rebounds . Point guard Rajon Rondo set the Kings ' single - game record with 20 assists while adding 14 points , eight rebounds and four steals . He also threw the pass that helped force overtime and has been putting up huge numbers as of late for a Sacramento squad that has been defensively challenged this season . Rondo has four triple - doubles and two double - doubles in his past nine games . It was certainly `` Kemba Time '' in Charlotte on Monday night , as Walker looked like the guard that led UConn to a National Championship . He was able to get pretty much whatever shot he wanted with Rondo and Darren Collison unable to contain him . With the win , the Hornets remained one of the NBA 's best home teams with a 6 - 1 record . Nicolas Batum had an off night shooting the basketball , but nearly contributed a triple - double with the extra frame , finishing with 18 points , 10 rebounds and eight assists over 43 minutes . The Kings wrap up a five - game road trip Wednesday against the Bucks ; the Hornets play the fourth of a seven - game homestand against the Wizards .
The Los_Angeles Clippers ( 20 - 13 ) defeated the Charlotte Hornets ( 17 - 14 ) Wednesday 122 - 117 at Time Warner Cable Arena in Charlotte . Despite being without their star in the frontcourt , Blake Griffin , the Clippers continue to roll as this victory was their fourth straight . It was a steady battle throughout the night , but LA was able to open up a large enough lead in the first quarter to hold on . They were lead by J.J. Redick , who scored an incredibly efficient 26 points in 27 minutes while shooting 5 - of - 6 from three . Chris Paul notched a double - double of 19 points and 11 assists on top of five rebounds in 30 minutes , while DeAndre Jordan added one of his own , finishing with 13 points and 13 boards in 33 minutes . The surprise performance of the night came from Austin Rivers , who scored 22 points in just 20 minutes off the bench . The team’s offensively efficiency is what carried them to victory , as they shot 50 percent from three and 52 percent overall . For the Hornets , Kemba Walker had a huge night , scoring 29 points and dishing out seven assists in 37 minutes . Additionally , Frank Kaminsky continues to improve in his rookie campaign , as he finished with 20 points in 28 minutes off the bench , while Jeremy Lamb added 19 of his own as a reserve . Up next , the Clippers will head to New Orleans Thursday to take on the Pelicans , while the Hornets will head to Toronto Friday to play the Raptors .
The Oklahoma_City Thunder ( 24 - 10 ) routed the Hornets ( 17 - 16 ) in Charlotte on Saturday , 109 - 90 . The Thunder have been on a tear of late , picking up 13 of their last 15 games . After a mediocre start , OKC has established themselves comfortably as the third - ranked team in the Western Conference , and have slowly been gaining on the second seed San Antonio Spurs , who currently rank dead last in strength of schedule . 2014 MVP Kevin Durant led the way for the Thunder with a 29 - point scoring performance . Durant paired the impressive points total with 11 rebounds and four blocked shots , contributing to the Thunder 's impressive 15 total blocks . All-NBA point guard Russell Westbrook showcased his skill too , posting a well - rounded stat line of 16 points , six rebounds , and seven assists . The dynamic duo of Durant and Westbrook has been elecrtic this season , as both players rank in the top four in the league in scoring . The Hornets , meanwhile , got off to a blazing hot start this season but have slowed down recently . Charlotte is now just 7 - 9 in the month of December and have dropped three straight games . Star point guard Kemba Walker , however , has not wavered in the face of the losing streak . Walker delivered a dominant 32 points , which he coupled with three steals on the defensive end . Walker 's effort was not enough , however , as the team was held to just 35 percent shooting from the field on the night . OKC will hope to continue playing winning basketball as they prepare to take on the Sacramento Kings on Monday . Charlotte , on the other hand , will face a tough challenge as they take to the road against the 30 - 2 Golden State Warriors on Monday .
The Charlotte Hornets ( 24 - 25 ) dealt the Eastern Conference-leading Cleveland Cavaliers ( 35 - 13 ) their second loss under coach Tyronn Lue on Wednesday , winning 106 - 97 in Charlotte . Despite a severe slide to start the new year , Charlotte remains in the mix for the Eastern Conference playoffs . The team has now won five or their last seven games , including a 101 - 82 blowout of the Los Angeles Lakers . The Hornets hold one of the largest disparities between home and road record in the league , as they are now 17 - 8 at Time Warner Cable Arena but just 7 - 17 away from their home court .

Lin delivered 24 points , five rebounds and eight assists , leading the team in both scoring and dimes dished . Recently returned defensive anchor Michael Kidd-Gilchrist delivered an 11 - point , 13 - rebound double double , while rookie lottery pick Frank Kaminsky provided a spark off the bench with 15 points .

Power forward Kevin Love was held to a paltry 4 - for - 12 from the field , while shooting guard JR Smith also went cold , going just 5 - for - 14 on the night . The non - Love members of the big three still put up a strong fight , however , with Kyrie Irving scoring a team - high 26 points and LeBron James going for 23 points , six rebounds , and six assists . The Cavaliers will host the Celtics on Friday . Charlotte will also see action on Friday , as they play host to the Miami Heat .
The Charlotte Hornets ( 33 - 28 ) defeated the visiting Indiana Pacers ( 32 - 30 ) 108 - 101 , on Friday night at Time Warner Cable Arena . The Hornets came into this game ranked sixth in the East , half a game ahead of the seventh place Pacers , whom they recently overtook in the standings .

Paul George has averaged 27 points in the last two meetings with the Hornets this season .

The Charlotte Hornets ( 37 - 28 ) defeated the Houston Rockets ( 33 - 33 ) 125 - 109 on Saturday . The Hornets came into the game riding a six - game win streak , and came out of the gate against Houston looking like it . They raced out to a 34 - 19 lead after one period on the strength of solid first quarters from their stalwart trio of Kemba Walker , Nicolas Batum and Marvin Williams . The Rockets woke from their slumber in the middle periods , winning the second and third quarters by a margin of 68 - 56 , but Charlotte managed to regain their grip on the game in the fourth and pull away for their 25th home victory of the season . The shooting made all the difference for the Hornets , who tallied 55 and 48 percent success rates from the field and three - point range , respectively . Meanwhile , their defense managed to completely stifle James Harden 's lethal long - range game , and limited the Rockets to a 19 percent figure from beyond the arc overall .

In the midst of a five - game losing streak and with their grip on a Western Conference seed growing increasingly tenuous , Mavericks head coach Rick Carlisle decided to call an audible with his starting five against one of the hottest teams in the league . In to the first unit stepped Raymond Felton , sending Zaza Pachulia to the bench for the night . The rather unusual move worked , as Felton hauled in 12 rebounds in addition to contributing nine points , helping to lead Dallas to a much - needed victory that snapped the Hornets ' seven - game winning streak . The Mavericks played stingy defense against a Charlotte team that had been essentially hitting on all cylinders , holding them to a 42 percent success rate from the field , and a 30 percent figure from three - point range .

Charlotte came into the night with their playoff berth long sewn up , but with eyes on a division title and improvement in their overall playoff seeding . They took care of business by handling the revamped Nets , who provided Chris McCullough with his first career start . The Hornets benefited from the return to the starting lineup of Nicolas Batum , who had missed the last two games with a left knee strain , and also saw their second unit contribute 54 points on the night , with three players hitting double - digit scoring .

The Utah Jazz ( 8 - 7 ) held off the New_Orleans Pelicans ( 4 - 13 ) 101 - 87 on Saturday . Utah had a 16 - point lead going into the fourth quarter and it 's nearly impossible to beat this stingy defense with that sort of deficit . The rebounding was the big difference in the game , as the Jazz snatched 49 boards compared to 35 for the Pelicans . These are teams going in opposite directions and the Jazz proved tonight that good defense will always prevail . New_Orleans came into this game as the worst defense in the NBA and the 101 points allowed is a significant improvement on those ugly numbers . It 's still not good enough to win and it does n't look that great when you notice that Utah currently has one of the three - worst offenses in the league . New_Orleans got a fantastic game out of Anthony Davis though , as he tallied 36 points , 11 rebounds , three blocks and two steals in the loss . The more amazing part about that game is that it 's one night after being carried off the floor with a knee injury . What hurt the Pelicans on this night was the rest of the starters , as the four others combined for just 14 points , six rebounds , and five assists . That 's almost a nearly identical line to what Ish Smith provided off the bench on Saturday as well , and the Pelicans simply need more from their other starters . New_Orleans will have to take on another potent defense when they play the Memphis Grizzlies on Tuesday . The Jazz played this game without Derrick Favors and they did n't miss a beat . Favors missed the game for an unknown personal reason , but Trevor Booker filled - in spectacularly . Booker amassed 13 points , 15 rebounds , three assists , three blocks and two steals in the win . Alec Burks was also fantastic off the bench , as he led the team with 21 points and provided an additional five rebounds and four assists . This is a dominant defense , so when players like Booker and Burks can produce like this , they 'll be tough to beat . Utah will play the undefeated Golden State Warriors on Monday in their next scheduled game and it should be a great test for this defense against the best offense in the NBA .
The Pelicans ( 7 - 18 ) notched a rare road win Wednesday at the Vivint Smart Home Arena , 104 - 94 over the Utah Jazz ( 10 - 14 ) . Down three to open the fourth quarter , the Pelicans completely stifled the Jazz down the stretch and allowed only __ fourth quarter points to run away with the game in the final minutes . The Pelicans got hot from three - point land , as they knocked down 10 of their 21 attempts , led by Eric Gordon 's 4 - 7 shooting effort from deep . Gordon led Pelicans starters with 19 points , but the game 's high scorer was Ryan Anderson off the bench with 24 points , fueled by a perfect 13 - 13 night from the free throw line .

Trey Burke led all Jazz bench sscorers with 12 points , and he dished out five assists .

The Jazz have now lost four straight and will look to reverse things at home Friday night against the Nuggets .
The Los_Angeles Clippers ( 18 - 13 ) defeated the Utah Jazz ( 12 - 16 ) 109 - 104 on Saturday . The Clippers came into Saturday’s matchup as part of the second game of a back - to - back , and utilized the 3 - point shot to make up for defensive breakdowns early in the game . Los_Angeles was without Blake Griffin ( quad ) , who is amongst the league 's best with 23 points per game and 9 rebounds per game , but that did not stop Chris Paul and DeAndre Jordan from running the pick and roll at an efficient rate . Add that to J.J. Reddick and Paul Pierce’s sharp shooting from deep and the equation resulted in a second straight win . Reddick led all Clippers’ with 25 points on 5 - of - 7 3 - point shooting , including a streak of three straight deep balls on consecutive possessions in the second half . Paul Pierce was equally impressive , finishing with 20 points on 5 - of - 7 behind the arc . Pure point guard Chris Paul added 19 points and 11 assists , while DeAndre Jordan completed another double - double , with 14 points and 13 rebounds . The first half defensive inefficiencies need to be addressed by the Clippers , but the team shot 50 percent from deep as a unit , which made up for the slow , turnover ridden start . Los_Angeles will continue their road trip and face the Washington Wizards ( 14 - 14 ) on Monday . Utah stormed out to a strong 1st quarter , but were unable to capitalize on the momentum going forward . Gordon Hayward led all scorers with 28 points , to go along with six rebounds and five assists on 7 - of - 13 shooting . The backcourt duo of Alec Burks and Trey Burke , who currently combine for the best scoring bench duo in the league , thrived in the first half before going cold later in the latter quarters . Burks finished with 11 points on a perfect 5 - of - 5 shooting in 18 minutes , while Michigan product Burke , added five points in the same amount of time . Rudy Gobert ( knee ) continues to miss games with a knee injury , and the absence of their shot blocking big man has caused the Jazz to run a small lineup . The lack of size and rim protection allowed DeAndre Jordan to take advantage for the inopportune , easy basket . Utah’s biggest strength in the first period was their pace , but as that died out in the second half , so did the team as a whole . Utah will look to bounce back when they host the Philadelphia 76ers ( 2 - 30 ) on Monday .
The Utah Jazz ( 13 - 16 ) defeated the Philadelphia 76ers ( 2 - 31 ) 95 - 91 on Monday . The Philadelphia 76ers may only have two wins on their lowly season , but recently acquired point guard Ish Smith has provided a spark in the backcourt for the NBA’s last place team . A semblance of offense looks to be in motion with Smith at the helm , as the 76ers overcame a 58 - 45 halftime deficit , and were competitive through the last possessions of the game . Smith finished with 22 points and dished out 11 assists on 8 - of - 21 shooting in 32 minutes . The Wake Forest product made a beautiful move to get a solid look to tie the game with the shot clock turned off in the 4th quarter , but the shot did not fall . JaKarr Sampson got the start in favor of the injured Jahlil Okafor ( knee ) and provided six points and five rebounds in 19 minutes . Nerlens Noel was effective under the rim , as the big man blocked five shots , to go along with 18 points and six rebounds . Richaun Holmes also contributed 18 points in the losing effort . Philadelphia could not find a rhythm from 3 - point territory , shooting 24 percent as a unit . The 76ers will visit the Sacramento Kings ( 12 - 18 ) on Wednesday . The Jazz earned a tough win , even after storming out to a 21 point lead in the first half . Gordon Hayward put forth a volume effort , and although his percentage was not in the realm of efficiency , his 3 - pointer in the final :30 gave Utah the lead , and eventually , the win . Hayward led all scorers with 24 points , to go along with six rebounds and four assists on 6 - of - 21 shooting . Jeff Withey drew the start , as Derrick Favors ( back ) sat his second consecutive game . Withey added a double - double in the win , scoring 11 points and bringing in 12 rebounds in 23 minutes . Utah did the majority of their damage from the free throw line , nailing 32 - of - 36 from the charity stripe , which made up for the horrid 33 percent shooting from the field . Trey Burke led the bench with 14 points . The Jazz head to Minnesota to face the struggling Timberwolves ( 11 - 20 ) on Wednesday .
The Sacramento Kings ( 16 - 21 ) defeated the Utah Jazz ( 17 - 22 ) 103 - 101 on Thursday night . One look at the statistics would indicate a Sacramento blowout , but this game came down to the final shot . Utah actually hit a game - tying three with four seconds left , but Rudy Gay ruined that moment of joy for Jazz fans by hitting a mid - range jumper to win the game . The Kings got off to a 26 - 12 start after the first quarter and barely held on late for the win . Sacramento outrebounded the Jazz 54 - 38 and outshot them 46 percent to 42 percent . What killed Utah was it 's three - point shooting , as they went 6 - for - 34 from long range . Sacramento has been playing their best basketball of the season over recent weeks and got an impressive road win here . It was once again DeMarcus Cousins who carried the load , as he is now the leading scorer in the NBA since the calendar turned . Cousins put together a 36 point and 17 rebound line in this win and dominated the Jazz frontcourt all game long . Rudy Gay also had a big game , as he tallied 24 points and nine rebounds while also hitting the game - winner . Rajon Rondo added to his league - leading assist total , as he dished out 13 dimes in yet another strong performance . The Kings will have to take on the Los Angeles Clippers in their next game , who currently hold the longest winning streak in the NBA . Utah got off to a horrendous start tonight and just couldn’t quite pull off the comeback late . Gordon Hayward , Trey Burke and Rodney Hood are the three best shooters on this team and they all shot horribly here . In fact , they combined to go 2 - for - 22 from three - point range in the loss . While Hayward mightily struggled with his shot , he still managed to tally 21 points and eight rebounds in a solid game . Trey Lyles also had an impressive game filling in for Derrick Favors , as he scored a career - high 19 points in the loss . This team is hard to figure out and while they are scary at times , they can be downright bad at others . With that said , they 'll have a good chance to bounce - back against the Los Angeles Lakers on Saturday in their next game .
The Utah Jazz ( 23 - 25 ) picked up a Western Conference home win Wednesday over the Denver Nuggets ( 19 - 31 ) at Vivint Smart Home Arena , 85 - 81 .

Danilo Gallinari battled through a tough shooting night ( 5 - 16 FG ) to score a game - high 24 points , powered by a brilliant 12 - 14 performance at the free throw line . Kenneth Faried scored an efficient 14 points on 5 - 8 shooting and Will Barton dropped a 10 - point , 10 - rebound double - double in 23 minutes off the bench . But the offense for the Nuggets was stagnant , as they assisted on just 11 field goals and turned the ball over 14 times , preventing them from snatching the road win .

This gives Milwaukee their fifth - straight loss and it was an extremely tough night on the offensive end . No player scored more than 18 points in the loss with the five starters combining for 18 turnovers . Khris Middleton 's 18 points , six rebounds and three steals look good , but considering he shot 6 - for - 16 and committed nine turnovers , it was actually very ugly . Jerryd Bayless gave the team a nice spark off the bench , as he scored 15 points . Milwaukee will have a few days off until they play the Boston Celtics on Monday in their next game . Utah has been playing their best defense of the season in recent weeks and it came to a head here . Rudy Gobert and Derrick Favors were incredible down low , as they combined for 23 rebounds , seven steals and eight blocks in the win .

The Los_Angeles Clippers ( 51 - 28 ) defeated the Utah Jazz ( 39 - 40 ) 102 - 99 in overtime on Friday . The Clippers rested all of their starters for this game and escaped with an impressive win . Jamal Crawford was the hero , as he hit a game - winning three at the buzzer in overtime to win the game .

The San_Antonio Spurs ( 5 - 2 ) defeated the Sacramento Kings ( 1 - 7 ) 104 - 83 Monday at Sleep Train Arena in Sacramento . The game remained close through three quarters , as the return of DeMarcus Cousins , who was out with an Achilles injury , kept the Kings in the game . However , the Spurs dominated the fourth quarter , winning the period 34 - 19 and pulling away . Kawhi Leonard continues to lead the way for San_Antonio to start the season , as he finished with a game - high 24 points on an efficient 10 - of - 13 shooting in 32 minutes .

The Minnesota Timberwolves ( 8 - 8 ) defeated the Sacramento Kings ( 6 - 11 ) 101 - 91 on Friday . In a tightly - contested game , the rebounding and free - throw shooting ended up being the difference . Minnesota outrebounded Sacramento 45 - 35 and made 95 percent of their free - throws , while the Kings made just 60 percent of theirs . These are two talented teams who prefer to play up - tempo , but that was n't the case here . With a projected total of 216 , the 192 total was surprisingly low . Minnesota has been a strange team this year , as they continue to win on the road and lose at home . They are now 6 - 2 on the road and 2 - 6 at home . Usually a young team like this only plays well at home , but there 's something unique about this roster . The Timberwolves were led by Andrew Wiggins once again , who tallied 22 points and six rebounds in the win . They played this game without Ricky Rubio , but Zach LaVine filled - in admirably . LaVine amassed 19 points , eight rebounds and four assists in the victory . The 8 - 8 start is a fantastic sign for this rebuilding team and the future is extremely bright with all of these talented youngsters . The Wolves will look to keep this going against the Los Angeles Clippers on Sunday . The Kings played this game without superstar DeMarcus Cousins and it clearly hampered them here . Rudy Gay is usually asked to step up in these circumstances , but he had one of the worst games of his career . In fact , Gay shot 1 - for - 13 from the field to accumulate two points and four rebounds . With a game like that and no Cousins in the lineup , it 's nearly impossible for Sacramento to win . Sacramento did however get another spectacular game out of Rajon Rondo , who tallied 16 points , 16 assists and four rebounds in the loss . The Kings will need Boogie Cousins back for their next game if they want a chance , as they have to take on the undefeated Golden State Warriors on Saturday .
The Sacramento Kings ( 9 - 15 ) defeated the New_York Knicks ( 10 - 14 ) 99 - 97 on Thursday .

Carmelo Anthony started cold in the first half , but regained momentum in the second half and finished the night with 23 points , 14 rebounds and four assists on 8 - of - 21 shooting . With under 0:10 left to play in the fourth quarter , Arron Afflalo intercepted an inbound pass that Darren Collison could not get control of , which gave the Knicks a chance to tie or win the game . After a Knicks timeout , Anthony pulled up behind the arc , but could not get the shot to fall as time expired . Afflalo’s heads up steal went along with 14 points , four rebounds and two assists , but the shooting guard could not connect from the 3 - point line , going 0 - for - 6 in the effort . Kristaps Porzingis struggled in the second game of a back - to - back , finishing with 13 points and seven rebound on 36 percent shooting . The Knicks are now on a four game losing streak . The Sacramento Kings received a passionate and strong performance from DeMarcus Cousins , who led all scorers with 27 points and 11 rebounds . Rajon Rondo threaded the needle in his signature fashion on multiple set pieces and added 16 points alongside 12 assists , including a one handed jam that got Sleep Train Arena on their feet . Omri Caspi drained the two free throws the ended up being the difference at the conclusion of the game and completed the night with 11 points , eight rebounds and three assists . Darren Collison was effective off the bench adding 16 points and three assists in 24 minutes . George Karl only used eight of his players , as Quincy Acy , James Anderson , Caron Butler , Seth Curry and Eric Moreland did not play . The Knicks continue their road trip and will play Portland Trail Blazers ( 9 - 14 ) on Saturday , while the Kings host the Houston Rockets ( 11 - 12 ) on Tuesday .
The Golden_State Warriors ( 35 - 2 ) defeated the Sacramento Kings ( 15 - 22 ) 128 - 116 on Saturday . The Warriors extended their win streak to six games through excellent ball movement and selfless basketball , which has become a staple to their improved season . It was the fifth time over the last six games that Golden_State eclipsed 30 assists in a game , as they passed their way to 35 total dimes . Stephen Curry is making the strongest case to defend his MVP title and led all scorers with 38 points , 11 assists and six rebounds on 12 - of - 21 shooting . Curry added eight more 3 - point shots to his NBA leading 162 treys . Klay Thompson is currently second amongst all deep threats , but was not nearly as effective as his backcourt partner , and finished 1 - of - 7 from behind the arc . Thompson was effective late in the game , hooking up with Andrew Bogut for some devastating backdoor cuts and added 15 points , four rebounds and six assists . Draymond Green is becoming accustomed to rounding out the box score , and although Green did not capture his ninth triple - double of the season , he did finish with 25 points , nine assists and four rebounds on 8 - of - 12 shooting in 34 minutes . Harrison Barnes was reserved to the bench and is being given slightly more minutes , as he eases his way back after missing 16 games with an ankle injury . The UNC product shot the ball much better in his 24 minutes , adding 10 points on 4 - of - 7 shooting . The Warriors will welcome the Miami Heat ( 22 - 15 ) on Monday . Sacramento mounted a late comeback to pull the game within striking distance in the 4th quarter to pad the 12 points loss , as DeMarcus Cousins found his stroke from beyond the arc . Cousins went 2 - of - 6 from 3 - point territory , but the two that fell came at clutch moments . The Kings’ star center scored 33 points , in addition to 10 rebounds on 12 - of - 27 shooting . Rudy Gay contributed on the scoring front and poured in 23 points in a game high 38 minutes , while Darren Collison and Marco Belinelli scored double figures off the bench . Willie Cauley-Stein ( finger ) was probable before the game , but suited up and added 10 points in nine minutes . The return of the Kings first round draft pick provides some extra depth , especially on the defensive end , for Sacramento moving forward . The Kings will take a few days off before hosting the New Orleans Pelicans ( 11 - 24 ) on Wednesday .
The Sacramento Kings ( 19 - 23 ) defeated the Atlanta Hawks ( 26 - 18 ) 91 - 88 on Thursday night . Both teams came into this game in the midst of three - game winning streaks and both teams came in on the back end of a back - to - back set . It was clear there were some tired legs out there , as the shooting was off with a much lower score than anticipated . Both squads combined to shoot well under 40 percent from the field with the two teams combining to go 15 - for - 57 from three - point range while committing 19 turnovers each . What ultimately got Sacramento their win was an 180 run in the third quarter in which the Hawks went nearly six minutes without scoring . Atlanta was able to fight back and get it to a tied ball game , but still couldn’t prevail late . Another huge key was the rebounding , as the Kings snatched down 56 boards to the Hawks 42 . This snapped a 15 - game winning streak for Atlanta over Sacramento , which was one of the longest current streaks in the NBA . Atlanta has been struggling with their frontcourt defense all season and that became another huge issue tonight . It 's one thing to allow DeMarcus Cousins to have a monster game , but allowing a rookie like Willie Cauley-Stein to record a double - double as well is unacceptable . No Hawks player had a great game tonight aside from Paul Millsap , who tallied 14 points , 14 rebounds , three assists , five steals and four blocks in another spectacular all - around game . Millsap looks poised to make the All-Star team this year ad it 's because of his ability to stuff the stat sheet like he did tonight . Jeff Teague has had a down year by his standards and he struggled yet again here , as he shot 2 - for - 8 while amassing just four points and four assists in the loss . In fact , he was benched for long stretches of this game , including the majority of the fourth quarter . Atlanta gets a much needed day off on Friday and then they get a good matchup against the Phoenix Suns on Saturday in their next game . Sacramento has quietly been one of the best teams in the west over the last two months and wins like this show why . They now have wins over the Hawks , Los Angeles Clippers and Oklahoma City Thunder over their last three weeks and that 's indicative of how much they have improved over recent weeks . DeMarcus Cousins has been the best player in the world in that stretch and he continued it here , by recording 24 points , 15 rebounds , five assists and three steals in the win . All five starters scored in double - figures and that 's a great sign with Rudy Gay sitting out this game with a heel injury . Rajon Rondo didn’t shoot well , but he did accumulate 11 points , 10 rebounds and 11 assists in yet another triple - doubling performance . Sacramento will look to extend their winning streak to five games on Saturday against the Indiana Pacers .
The Utah Jazz ( 31 - 35 ) picked up a road win over the Sacramento Kings ( 25 - 40 ) Sunday night at Sleep Train Arena , 108 - 99 . With the win , the Jazz move with two games of the Dallas Mavericks for the Western Conference 's eighth and final playoff spot . This one was n't as close as the final score suggests , as the Jazz never trailed and held leads of 20 points or more in each of the second , third and fourth quarters . Derrick Favors dominated the middle for the Jazz as he finished with a team - high 28 points and a game - high 14 rebounds .

Tha Jazz finish a back - to - back Monday at home against the Cavaliers . The Kings hit the road for a Tuesday matchup against the Lakers .
The New_Orleans Pelicans ( 25 - 42 ) defeated the Sacramento Kings ( 26 - 41 ) 123 - 108 at Sleep Train Arena on Wednesday . Anthony Davis and Ryan Anderson put on a scoring clinic in the blowout , as both players took advantage of their matchups against the struggling Kings . Sacramento is 1 - 9 over their last 10 games and the team has fallen off the wagon since the all - star break .

Davis scored 27 points and grabbed 14 rebounds on 10 - of - 20 shooting , while Ryan Anderson was lethal in 26 minutes off the bench and finished with 29 points that included five baskets from behind the arc . Omer Asik has received sporadic minutes over the last few games , but earned the starting nod on Wednesday after not playing any minutes on Monday . Asik contributed a lowly five points , to go along with four rebounds in the unimpressive performance . New_Orleans shot selection was all but unstoppable for Sacramento , as they shot 54 percent as a unit . The Kings look monotonous since dropping off in the playoff chase , and their struggle on the defensive end of the floor has opened up blowout losses . They entered the game without the depth of Rajon Rondo ( thumb/shoulder ) and Marco Belinelli ( ankle ) , which posed major mismatches in the backcourt . The help defense at the rim was also absent , save for DeMarcus Cousins doing whatever he can to keep his team in the game . Cousins finished with 20 points , 12 rebounds , five assists and two blocks on 8 - of - 21 shooting , while Darren Collison impressed on the offensive end with 23 points , which included a perfect 3 - of - 3 from deep . After the brutal second quarter , the Kings bounced back in the third quarter and chipped six points off lead , but it was far from enough to bring the game close enough to compete . Both teams play on Friday , as the Kings will visit the Detroit Pistons ( 34 - 34 ) , while the Pelicans will host the Damian Lillard and the Portland Trail Blazers ( 35 - 33 ) .
The Miami Heat ( 44 - 31 ) defeated the Sacramento Kings ( 30 - 46 ) 112 - 106 on Friday night . Miami had a huge lead early in this game and the Kings made it much closer than they rightfully should have . Sacramento outscored Miami 30 - 20 in the fourth quarter , but the Heat made some big plays late to escape with the win . The offense was the key for the Heat , as they shot 51 percent from the field , 95 percent from the free - throw line and 55 percent from three - point range . Miami played this game without Dwyane Wade and ended up with a huge road win . In fact , the victory put them in a three - way tie for the division lead , with less than 10 games left . Gerald Green led all scorers with 30 points , starting for Wade . Joe Johnson played extremley well too , as he tallied 14 points , five rebounds and eight assists . Goran Dragic and Luol Deng both scored 17 points a piece as well . Up next for Miami is a matchup with the Portland Trail Blazers on Saturday . The Kings also had to play this game without their superstar , as DeMarcus Cousins was suspended for this matchup .

The Lakers will look to recover from their funk on Tuesday as they travel to Miami to take on the Heat . Meanwhile , the Knicks will look to even out their record on Tuesday in Toronto .
The Miami Heat ( 10 - 5 ) defeated the New_York Knicks ( 8 - 9 ) 97 - 78 on Friday . Gerald Green 's first season in a Heat uniform has been anything but dull . The veteran has managed to overcome recent personal problems to serve as an integral part of the Miami bench , as well as a terrific spot starter . Green filled in at small forward for Luol Deng for a second consecutive contest and propelled the Heat to a road victory with a team - high , game - high , and season - high 25 points . The particularly remarkable aspect of his performance was the fact that Green had only tallied only 5 points by intermission . However , a second - half offensive barrage that included three of his four three - pointers on the night helped Miami significantly extend what had been a razor - thin 50 - 49 halftime lead , and cruise to an eventual 21 - point win . Green 's effort was complemented nicely by Chris Bosh , who managed 20 points , five rebounds , three assists and a block . Dwyane Wade pitched in with 17 points , five rebounds and a trio of assists . Hassan Whiteside had his worst shooting night of the season , going only 1 - for - 6 from the field , making it his first single - digit scoring night in over two weeks and only the fourth game in which he has scored under 10 points . However , the standout center did haul in 14 boards , the third consecutive game in which he 's hit double - digit rebounds . Rookie Justice Winslow received a robust 35 minutes off the bench , and although he was n't terribly efficient with them , he did round out the stat sheet nicely . The Heat 's 2015 first - round pick finished with nine points , seven rebounds , an assist and a steal . The Heat improved to 10 - 5 and are in possession of first place in the Eastern Conference 's Southeast Division . They remain home for a date with the Celtics on Monday . The Knicks were thoroughly stymied by Miami 's suffocating defense , shooting only 38 percent from the field for the game and barely seeing two of five starters crack double - digit scoring . Carmelo Anthony was one of those players , but the superstar small forward could only muster 11 points , three rebounds , an assist and a steal over 34 minutes . It tied the veteran 's season - low scoring total , which he 'd posted in the opener versus Milwaukee . Kristaps Porzingis matched Anthony 's 11 points and added eight rebounds , two steals and three blocks . Robin Lopez , Arron Afflalo and Jose Calderon-the rest of the starting five - - only totaled eight points between them . Reserve forward Kevin Seraphin was the only other New_York player to reach double figures , tallying 10 points , three rebounds and an assist over a very efficient 17 minutes . The Knicks fell to 8 - 9 and currently reside in third place in the Eastern Conference 's Atlantic Division . They remain home for a date with the Rockets on Sunday .
The New_York Knicks ( 9 - 10 ) defeated the Philadelphia 76ers ( 1 - 19 ) 99 - 85 on Wednesday at Madison Square Garden in New_York . After securing their first win of the season on Tuesday , the Sixers were hoping to get their momentum moving in the right direction . Unfortunately , that was n't the case Wednesday , as the Knicks came in and snapped a four - game losing streak of their own with the 14 - point victory over the Sixers.The Sixers forced the Knicks into 17 turnovers as a team , but could n't get anything going offensively , shooting just 37 percent from the field and 32 percent from the three - point line . Conversely , the Knicks shot 44 percent from the floor and 20 percent from deep . It was Kristaps Porzingis , the Knicks ' electrifying first - round pick , who again stole the show Wednesday . Porzingis was very efficient offensively , scoring a team - high of 17 points ( 6 - 10 FG , 2 - 2 3Pt , 3 - 3 FT ) , to go along with 10 rebounds and four blocked shots . He 's now notched two double - doubles in a row , which brings his season total to nine . Porzingis is averaging 14 points , 9 rebounds and 2 blocks on the season . After missing Sunday 's game due to an illness , superstar Carmelo Anthony returned to the lineup . Anthony did n't have the best game shooting the ball , but still finished with 12 points ( 5 - 16 FG , 0 - 3 3Pt , 2 - 2 FT ) , while also adding six rebounds and a pair of assists . Anthony has combined to shoot just 9 - for - 29 from the field and 1 - for - 6 from the three - point line over his last two games , so he 'll look to turn things around moving forward . Arron Afflalo chipped in with 13 points ( 6 - 10 FG , 1 - 4 3Pt ) and eight rebounds as well . With Jahlil Okakor being suspended two games due to a few off - court incidents , the Sixers had JaKarr Sampson move into the starting lineup . Sampson led all Sixer scorers with 12 points ( 4 - 7 FG , 0 - 2 3Pt , 4 - 5 FT ) , to go along with five rebounds over 23 minutes . The 12 points were the most he 's scored since the season opener , considering he 's averaging just 6 points and 3 rebounds on the season . Sampson should get the start again Saturday with Okafor remaining out on suspension . Hollis Thompson and Richaun Holmes came off the bench and tried to give the Sixers a much - needed spark . Thompson recorded 13 points ( 5 - 12 FG , 3 - 5 3Pt ) and four rebounds , while Holmes added 11 points ( 4 - 6 FG , 0 - 1 3Pt , 3 - 4 FT ) and three rebounds . The Knicks ' next game will be at home against the Brooklyn Nets on Friday , while the Sixers will head home to play the Denver Nuggets on Saturday .
The New_York Knicks ( 25 - 35 ) defeated the Orlando Magic ( 25 - 32 ) 108 - 95 on Friday . The Magic made the trek up to the Big Apple after a 130 - 114 blowout defeat on Thursday in Orlando at the hands of the reigning NBA champs . The Knicks jumped on the likely - tired visitors early , building a 62 - 44 halftime lead . Although the Magic came out a bit reenergized out of intermission , New_York 's workmanlike effort kept them at an advantage , and led to a comfortable double - digit victory . The hosts were just a bit better than their guests in every category Friday , with New_York sporting a 46 percent to 42 percent shooting advantage from the floor , a 25 percent to 22 percent edge from beyond the arc , and also prevailing 51 - 47 on the glass .

The Magic remain in last place in the Eastern Conference 's Southeast Division , and five games back of the eighth - seeded Charlotte Hornets . They 're back home on Sunday to face off against the Philadelphia 76ers .

Arron Afflalo surprisingly added 12 boards to his scoring haul , along with a trio of assists and a steal . Robin Lopez supplemented his total with eight boards , a steal and a pair of blocks , while Jose Calderon also contributed three boards and an assist . Even the reserves got in on the act , with Derrick Williams and Lance Thomas pacing the bench with a pair of 11 - point outings .

The Knicks remain in third place in the Eastern Conference 's Atlantic Division , and are five and a half games back of the eighth - seeded Charlotte Hornets . They 're home again on Sunday to face off against the Miami Heat .
The Indiana Pacers ( 41 - 36 ) defeated the New_York Knicks ( 31 - 47 ) 92 - 87 on Sunday . This game meant a whole lot more to the Pacers than the Knicks and they were lucky to escape with a win . The second quarter was the only quarter that Indiana won , but they domianted to the tune of a 36 to 18 scoreline . The key for the Pacers was their defense , as they held the Knicks to 34 percent shooting . The Knicks played this game without Carmelo Anthony and Jose Calderon and had one of their best peformances in weeks . Robin Lopez stepped up big , as he amassed 10 points , 15 rebounds and six blocks . Sasha Vujacic led the team with 21 points in his revived role . Arron Afflalo was leaned on late and scored 15 points on just 5 - for - 15 shooting . On deck for the Knicks is a matchup with the Charlotte Hornets on Tuesday . Indiana is now 3 games up in the eight - seed , so this was obviously a crucial win . Paul George was the star for the Pacers , as he tallied 20 points and nine rebounds . Rodney Stuckey gave the team a great spark off the bench , as he scored 17 points . Up next for Indiana is a matchup with the Cleveland Cavaliers on Wednesday .
The Golden_State Warriors ( 33 - 2 ) rolled over the Los_Angeles Lakers ( 8 - 28 ) 109 - 88 on Tuesday night . In a game that was a major mismatch on paper , there wasn’t much fight from the big underdog . The starters for the Warriors dominated in the first and third quarters , as they outscored the Lakers 67 - 38 in that 24 - minute stretch . Usually the Warriors win by outscoring teams , but they played some of their best defense of the season here . The Lakers shot just 32 percent from the field and 24 percent from long distance . This game was well out of hand early and mismatches like this are ugly to watch for NBA fans . Not many teams can keep up with Golden_State and especially not the Lakers . The Warriors blitzed them in the first quarter and then hit them even harder coming out after the half time . Klay Thompson was the star of the show , as he scored 22 first quarter points and finished the game with 36 in total . Steph Curry had to leave this game in the third quarter after re - aggravating his shin injury and Warriors fans have to be concerned at this point with hs continuous distress . After getting three - straight triple - doubles , Draymond Green had a subpar outing , by scoring just nine points while grabbing 12 rebounds in the win . Golden_State has a few days off until they play the Portland Trail Blazers on Friday in their next game . The Lakers came into this game with a miraculous three - game winning streak , but left with a blowout loss in an expected scenario . Considering the spread was at 15 points coming in , the final scoreline doesn’t look as bad . Only one Lakers player scored more than 11 points , as everyone struggled to find their shot . Jordan Clarkson was the only bright spot , as he scored a team - high 23 points in just 29 minutes of action . They did have to play this game without Kobe Bryant and D'Angelo Russell , but the result likely would have been the same even if those two played . Los_Angeles will look to bounce back in their next game against the surging Sacramento Kings on Thursday .
The Charlotte Hornets ( 23 - 25 ) defeated the Los_Angeles Lakers ( 9 - 41 ) 101 - 82 at Staples Center on Sunday . As the halfway point of the season has passed , and the upcoming all - star break is around the corner , the Lakers will likely look to start thinking about 2016 - 2017 and the NBA Draft because it was the same story with Los_Angeles , who picked up their 10th straight loss and dropped to 4 - 24 at home . Kobe Bryant played to the delight of the hometown crowd , and provided one of his better performances of the season , as he finished with 23 points , eight rebounds and three assists on 8 - of - 18 shooting in 23 minutes . The rout was on early for Charlotte , who stretched a double figure lead and danced around a 30 point blowout for most of the second half . The Lakers turned the ball over 15 times and Charlotte exploited the youthful Los_Angeles roster , specifically D’Angelo Russell , who converted five of the team 's turnovers . Russell contributed 10 points , six rebounds and one assist off the bench . Julius Randle strung together another double - double with 10 points and 11 rebounds , while his frontcourt partner , Roy Hibbert , finished with zero points and two boards in a weak showing from the veteran . Kemba Walker’s torrid shooting did not have a large impact on the Hornets all around effort , as the frontcourt combination of Michael Kidd-Gilchrist , who made his season debut on Friday against the Blazers , and Marvin Williams contributed 38 points and 24 rebounds . Even more impressively , they combined to go 6 - of - 10 from behind the arc , which constantly kept the game far out of reach from the Lakers . Nobody else on the Hornets was nearly as polarizing as the two forwards , but a bright spot came from rookie Frank Kaminsky , who finished with 11 points in 23 minutes off the bench . The Lakers will host the Minnesota Timberwolves ( 14 - 35 ) on Tuesday , while the Hornets will entertain LeBron James and the Cleveland Cavaliers ( 34 - 12 ) on Wednesday .
The San_Antonio Spurs ( 46 - 9 ) took care of the Los_Angeles Lakers ( 11 - 45 ) in a 119 - 113 win on Friday . The Spurs were embarrassed in their first game out of the All-Star break and bounced back nicely here . Despite allowing the Lakers to score 113 , the Spurs recorded 30 assists and won every significant statistic in this game , including shooting , rebounding , assisting and turnovers . San_Antonio 's shooting was especially impressive , as they shot 55 percent from the field , 94 percent from the free - throw line and 50 percent from long distance . This wasn’t the defensive performance the Spurs are known for , but a win is a win . Tony Parker had a renaissance game , as he scored 25 points and dished out six assists in the win . Tim Duncan also turned back the clock , as he double - doubled in a 12 - point , 13 - rebound outing . Nine players scored at least seven points for the Spurs , with the bench accumulating 50 points of their own . Up next for San_Antonio is a date with the Phoenix Suns on Sunday . The Lakers have been dreadful all season , but they continue to play the Spurs tough . This is the third - straight time that these two teams have gone down to the final minutes and it 's a wonder why . Kobe Bryant showed up big time in this game , as he scored 25 points in the loss . Lou Williams and Jordan Clarkson also played well , as they each scored 20 - plus points while combining for 41 in total . Julius Randle double - doubled in the loss , as he amassed 11 points and 15 rebounds as well . On deck is a matchup against the Chicago Bulls on Sunday .
The Cleveland Cavaliers ( 46 - 18 ) defeated the Los_Angeles Lakers ( 14 - 52 ) 120 - 108 at Staples Center on Thursday . Any other year , this meeting between the Eastern Conference’s best team and the Western Conference’s worst team would not make for a premier event , but given that it was the final time Kobe Bryant would face off against LeBron James , the night had some magic to it . Bryant and James have been the sole two players who have been highlighted in the past nine NBA Finals , but they never faced off the league’s biggest stage at the same time . The Black Mamba was not afraid of the competition , and turned back the clock with his most efficient shooting performance on the season , as he scored 26 points on 11 - of - 16 shooting in 32 minutes . The passing of the torch is not far away , and D’Angelo Russell has shown improvement over the course of the torrid season for Los_Angeles , as he continued to select good shots throughout the matchup . Russell scored 24 points , to go along with four rebounds and five assists , which made up for Jordan Clarkson’s first off night in some time after scoring a lowly five points on 2 - of - 12 shooting . Julius Randle looked good with his right hand , especially driving in the lane , and pitched in 15 points and nine boards . The Cavaliers did not pull away until the second half , but once their engine got moving , the Lakers were left in the dust of a double figure lead for a while . The box score reflects six Cavs scoring in double figures , led by Kyrie Irving’s 26 points . The Duke product added two rebounds and nine assists on 11 - of - 20 shooting , while King James added 24 points , five boards and seven assists . J.R. Smith is finding a rhythm over his last week and buried four three - pointers in the contest , to go along with an off the backboard assist to James that had even the Lakers fans out of their seats . Channing Frye contributed a shooting clinic , and seemed unable to miss throughout the entirety of the game , which was reflected by his 21 points on 80 percent shooting . Tristan Thompson took care of business on the rebounding end , keeping most of the Lakers bigs boxed out . The Lakers will welcome Carmelo Anthony and the New York Knicks ( 27 - 39 ) on Sunday , while the Cavaliers will play the same day , in the same arena , against the Los_Angeles Clippers ( 41 - 22 ) .
Kobe Bryant scored 60 points as the Los_Angeles Lakers ( 17 - 65 ) beat the Utah Jazz ( 40 - 42 ) in his farewell game , 101 - 96 . Bryant , who plans to retire after 20 NBA seasons , took a career - high 50 shots , making 22 field goals . He scored 38 in the second half as the Lakers overcame a 15 - point halftime deficit . The Lakers ' defense , which struggled all season , was surprsingly the key to the comeback , as it held the Jazz to just 39 points in the second half . The third - leading scorer in NBA history , Bryant became the oldest player to score 50 points in a game as he posted the fifth - highest scoring game of his career . Trey Lyles led the Jazz with 18 points , 11 rebounds and five steals . Gordon Hayward , who finished with 17 points , had the unfortunate task of covering Bryant . The Jazz were eliminated from the playoffs just before tip - off when the Houston Rockets beat the Sacramento Kings , the fourth consecutive season Utah has missed the playoffs . It marks the Jazz 's longest playoff drought since 1980 - 83 . With 12 points Jordan Clarkson was the only other player in double figures for the Lakers , who have missed the playoffs a franchise - high three straight seasons .
The Orlando Magic ( 7 - 8 ) defeated the New_York Knicks ( 8 - 8 ) 100 - 91 on Wednesday . The Magic and Knicks played a very strange game on Wednesday , as both teams shot terribly , but did n't make many mistakes . In fact , Both teams shot below 40 percent from the field and the two teams combined for just 18 turnovers . Defense was clearly the focus for both teams , as the Knicks failed to record a fast - break point all game long . There were very little differences in the stat sheet and it simply came down to the fact that the Magic 's bench signicantly outplayed the Knicks bench . Orlando got 43 bench points to the Knicks 12 and that proved to be the difference . The Knicks came into this game as one of the hottest teams in the league , but struggled offensively in this matchup . This Scott Skiles defense stifled the Knicks , despite the fact that Carmelo Anthony and Jose Calderon scored season - highs in points . Anthony had his best game of the season statistically speaking , as he tallied 28 points and 13 rebounds in the loss . Calderon also had his best game in years , as he totaled 25 points , four assists and three rebounds in the defeat . It was the `` others '' who killed this team though , as no other player scored more than 10 points in the loss . It 's clear that this team plays better when Anthony takes less shots and that was the fact yet again on Wednesday . The Knicks will play the Miami Heat on Friday in their next scheduled game . The Magic made a strange move by relegating Victor Oladipo to the bench , but that proved to work wonders here . It 's unclear if it lit a fire under him or that he just played better in the second unit , but Oladipo had one of his best games of the season in that role . Oladipo scored a team - high 24 points off the bench and did that damage in just 26 minutes of action . Tobias Harris , Nikola Vucevic and Elfrid Payton all recorded double - doubles as well , and this was one of the best all - around team efforts the Magic have had all season . Orlando will look to play like this again when they take on the struggling Milwaukee Bucks on Friday .
The Orlando Magic ( 15 - 11 ) defeated the Portland Trail_Blazers ( 11 - 17 ) 102 - 94 on Friday . The Trail_Blazers came into Friday 's contest with one of the worst defensive frontcourts in the NBA , surrendering a league - worst average of 22 points and 17 rebounds to opposing centers . This troubling trend for Portland was on full display Friday , with the Magic 's Nikola Vucevic tallying 25 points and 11 rebounds for his ninth double - double performance of the season . The Orlando center made a season - high 22 shot attempts , draining 12 of them for a solid 55 percentage from the field . Meanwhile , forward Tobias Harris pitched in with his own 25 - point double - double , and added 12 boards . Orlando completely dominated the contest down low , outscoring Portland by a resounding margin of 52 to 18 in the paint and outrebounding them 48 to 42 . Portland was led by a valiant effort from C.J. McCollum , who drained 11 of 19 shots on his way to a game - high 27 points . The third - year pro added six assists and a pair of rebounds . Backcourt mate Damian Lillard was solid as well , although he slogged through an atypical 4 - for - 15 shooting performance . Lillard did tally 19 points , but it was a total that was significantly supplemented by the nine free throw attempts that he successfully converted . Al-Farouq Aminiu had his most prolific scoring night in nearly two weeks with 16 points , an amount he reached with the help of a season - high four three - pointers . Allen Crabbe paced the Portland bench with the only other double - digit scoring effort on the team , amassing 14 points and adding four rebounds and an assist . The Trail_Blazers fell to 11 - 17 and remain in fourth place in the Western Conference 's Northwest Division . They head to Miami to face the Heat on Sunday . In addition to Vucevic 's and Harris ' outstanding efforts , Orlando also enjoyed the benefit of a stat - sheet - stuffing evening from point guard Elfrid Payton . The second - year pro managed 19 points , six rebounds , three assists , a pair of steals and a block , while visiting the free throw line a season - high 17 times . Victor Oladipo was also outstanding off the bench , pouring 15 points and adding six assists , four rebounds , three steals and a block over a robust 35 minutes . The third - year pro was pressed into extended action after starting shooting guard Evan Fournier sustained a dislocated pinkie finger and thus was limited to only 22 minutes . The Magic improved to 15 - 11 and currently reside in third place in the Eastern Conference 's Southeast Division . They remain home for a date with the Atlanta Hawks on Sunday .
The Magic ( 18 - 13 ) pulled away in the second half to defeat the Pelicans ( 10 - 21 ) 104 - 89 at Amway Center on Monday . Orlando has found success the past month largely due to the effort of Nikola Vucevic , who posted a season - high 28 points on 14 - of - 21 shooting from the field while adding eight rebounds and seven assists over 37 minutes . The Magic shot 55 percent on the night and destroyed the Pelicans in the paint , but were also incredibly efficient from beyond the arc , shooting 7 - of - 17 . The Pelicans got a brief scare in the third quarter when All-Star Anthony Davis went to the locker room after receiving a knee to the groin area . Fortunately he was able to return and finished with a team - high 20 points ( 9 - 16 FG , 0 - 2 3Pt , 2 - 5 FT ) to go along with eight rebounds . The minor injury caused a down night by Davis 's standards as he had posted at least 24 points and 12 rebounds in his previous three contests . New_Orleans did however get a big effort from Norris Cole , who scored a season - high 17 points on 8 - of - 14 shooting with eight rebounds and three assists over 30 minutes . Behind Vucevic were a slew of contributors , including Evan Fournier , who had another nice game shooting the ball Monday . Fournier has hit at least two 3 - pointers in his past four games and is shooting 46 percent from downtown in his past five . The Magic have now won six of their past eight games and are in the thick of the Eastern Conference playoff race with a matchup against the Nets set for Wednesday in Orlando .
The Orlando Magic ( 26 - 32 ) took care of the Philadelphia 76ers ( 8 - 51 ) in a 130 - 116 win on Sunday . Orlando came into this game as a rare double - digit favorite and didn’t disappoint . They really took control in the first half , as the Magic led 77 - 51 at the half . The shooting was stellar for Orlando , as they shot 57 percent from the field , 88 percent from the free - throw line and 63 percent from three - point range . The Magic starters actually combined for over 100 points for the first time all season . Not much is going right for the Sixers right now , as this marks their eighth - straight loss . Jahlil Okafor had yet another good game though , as he scored 26 points in the loss . Ish Smith also had a nice game , as he tallied 17 points , five rebounds and seven assists . Philadelphia has a short turnaround , as they play the Washington Wizards on Monday . Orlando has one of their best offensive games of the season , even without Evan Fournier . Victor Oladipo and Nikola Vucevic tied for the team - lead with 28 points in the win . Aaron Gordon continued his good play , as he amassed 22 points , seven rebounds and three assists in the victory . Elfrid Payton got out of his recent slump , as he scored 11 points and dished out 10 assists in the win . Up next for the Magic is a date with the Dallas Mavericks on Tuesday .
The Dallas Mavericks ( 5 - 4 ) defeated the Los_Angeles Lakers ( 1 - 8 ) 90 - 82 on Friday . Kobe Bryant had missed the last two games with a back injury and had originally been reported to be out of Friday 's contest as well . However , Bryant was healthy enough to take the floor after all , and posted his second - best scoring total of the season with 19 points on a season best 47 percent shooting . Bryant 's return sent Metta World_Peace back to the bench , where he failed to score over 17 minutes of action . The Lakers also received a team - best 21 points from Jordan Clarkson , which served as the young guard 's best game since his season - high 30 - point outburst versus the Nuggets on Nov. 3 . Rookie D'Angelo Russell tallied only nine points over 24 minutes , marking the third time in four games that he 's failed to score in double digits . Interestingly , Los_Angeles lost despite outrebounding the Mavericks 57 to 48 , led by Roy Hibbert and Julius Randle 's nine and 10 boards , respectively . Besides Bryant and Clarkson , backup guard Louis Williams was the only other Laker to hit double - digit points ( 10 ) . The Lakers fell to 1 - 8 and remain in last place in the Western Conference’s Pacific Division . They head home for a Sunday tilt versus the Pistons . The Mavericks benefited from an impressive double - double from offseason acquisition Zaza Pachulia , who posted 18 points and 16 rebounds . It was another forgettable performance for the Lakers ' frontcourt , who came into Friday night 's contest ranked last in scoring surrendered to opposing centers at an average of 25 points per game . Deron Williams supplemented Pachulia 's contributions with 13 points , seven rebounds , and three steals , while Dwight Powell pitched in with another highly efficient performance off the bench . Powell tallied 10 points , 12 rebounds , two assists , and a steal in just 22 minutes , and was the only other Dallas player with double - digit points . The Mavericks improved their record to 5 - 4 and move into second place in the Western Conference 's Southwest Division . They now travel to Houston for a Saturday night showdown with the Rockets .
The Dallas Mavericks ( 14 - 11 ) defeated the Phoenix Suns ( 11 - 15 ) by a score of 104 - 94 , Monday night in Dallas . After a back and forth start , Dallas took the lead with about two minutes to go in the first quarter and did not look back . Phoenix put up a fight with a strong 36 point fourth quarter , but Dallas withstood the attack , scoring 27 points of their own , to stay on top . The Suns were playing on the second night of a back - to - back and their shooting percentage indicates that they may have been a bit fatigued , as they shot only 41 percent from the field as a team . Eric Bledsoe led the way for the Suns , doing it all with 23 points , seven assists , five rebounds , three steals and two blocks . Unfortunately , he did not have too much help other than from Jon Leuer , who finished with 15 points and 13 rebounds , as well as three assists and one steal , in 32 minutes . Brandon Knight added 12 points on 5 - 11 shooting , four rebounds and three assists . Markieff Morris remained out for Phoenix . Dallas really took control when they outscored Phoenix 31 - 15 in the third quarter , stretching their lead to 19 , heading into the fourth .

Dirk Nowitzki showed well , with 14 points on 5 - 10 shooing , seven rebounds and four assists , in 29 minutes .

The host Dallas Mavericks ( 17 - 13 ) defeated the Chicago Bulls ( 16 - 12 ) by a score of 118 - 111 , on Saturday night . The game was a back - and - forth nail - biter , which featured 15 lead changes and was tied 108 - 108 with 2:54 left in the game . Dallas grinded out the last few minutes with some solid defense , including a big steal which led to a basket that put them up by four with 50 seconds left . The Bulls then gave up an unforced turnover on a five - second inbound violation that destroyed their chance of victory . Chicago came into this game after a solid win on Christmas day and while they are still missing two big pieces in Joakim Noah and Mike Dunleavy , being short - handed on this second night of a back - to - back could be part of the reason why they collapsed late in the fourth . Five players scored in double digits for the Bulls . The high - point man was Derrick Rose , who finished with 25 points ( 12 - 20 FG ) , five rebounds and four assists , in 36 minutes . Nikola Mirotic poured in 23 points on strong 6 - 10 shooting from the field ( 4 - 7 3PT , 7 - 11 FT ) , along with seven rebounds , three blocks , two steals and one assist , in 40 minutes . Pau Gasol finished with 18 points ( 7 - 10 FG , 4 - 4 FT ) , nine rebounds , three assists and three blocks , in 38 minutes . The Bulls starters were forced to play a lot of minutes in this one , which again could have affected their play late in the game . Chicago did however shoot a strong 53 percent from the field . Dallas also had six players score in double digits . J.J. Barea had a fantastic game filling in at starting PG for the injured Deron Williams . Barea finished with 26 points , while shooting a brilliant 7 - 8 from behind the arc , along with five assists , in 32 minutes . Chandler Parsons dropped in 20 points ( 8 - 15 FG , 2 - 5 3Pt ) , five rebounds , five assists and two steals , in 35 minutes off the bench . Zaza Pachulia tallied a solid double - double with 17 points and 12 rebounds , in 29 minutes . The Mavericks shot 48 percent from long range and hit 22 - 28 free throws . With this win Dallas is now 6 - 6 against the East . Next Dallas will host Milwaukee on Monday and look to go above .500 against the pesky East .

Lopez spearheaded the offensive cause once again versus the Suns , collecting 23 points and adding six rebounds , two assists and a block . Even on a night where frontcourt partner - in - crime Thaddeus Young had a down game by his standards , Lopez demonstrated the ability to once again put the offense on his shoulders and carry the Nets to a second consecutive victory . The visiting Suns enjoyed solid performances from three of their starters , but saw a couple of their more talented scorers trudge through poor performances . Brandon Knight scored a game - high 26 points , and added seven rebounds and four assists . It marked the Phoenix point guard 's third game in the last four where he 's totaled 21 points or more .

Jarrett Jack supported Lopez as the only other double - digit scorer in Brooklyn 's starting five , stuffing the stat sheet with 11 points , eight assists , four rebounds and three steals .

Young pitched in eight points , four rebounds and a pair of assists for only his second single - digit scoring night of the entire season . Impressive rookie Rondae Hollis-Jefferson ( eight points ) and veteran Joe Johnson ( nine points ) made modest contributions , although the former did add nine rebounds . Shane Larkin and Wayne Ellington paced the Brooklyn bench with a pair of 11 - point efforts , and made key contributions in the victory by scoring six and seven , respectively , in the final period .

The Brooklyn Nets ( 7 - 15 ) defeated the Philadelphia 76ers ( 1 - 22 ) 100 - 91 on Thursday for their second consecutive home victory . The story of the game turned out to be the two teams ' big men , who both put together atypical performances as compared to their recent efforts . Sixers center Jahlil Okafor had endured a rough last two weeks , posting three lackluster performances before serving a two - game suspension earlier this month for off - the - court scuffles on Thanksgiving Eve . He then was relegated to the bench in his first game back Monday , and shot 3 - for - 14 from the field during an embarassing 119 - 68 beatdown at the hands of the Spurs . Thursday , Okafor came back with a vengeance , responding with a 22 - point , 10 - rebound double - double over 31 minutes .

The eight - year veteran was held to single - digit scoring for the first time in the 2015 - 16 campaign , posting seven points , seven rebounds , an assist and a block during his limited time on the court . Okafor was actually the only starter for the visitors that was able to tally double - digit points , as the majority of support he received came from the bench in the form of T.J. McConnell and Richaun Holmes . McConnell collected 17 points and added a rebound , an assist and three steals , while Holmes managed double - digit scoring for the third time in the last four games ( 14 points ) . Nerlens Noel and Robert Covington could only pitch in a pair of six - point efforts , while Isaiah Canaan struggled through a 2 - for - 10 shooting night on the way to only four points . The one other bright spot in the starting five was Tony Wroten , who continued his comeback from January knee surgery by posting a season - high nine points , along with four rebounds , a pair of assists and a steal over 17 minutes . It was the third time in his three games this season that Wroten has increased his time on the court , as he works his way back to a starter 's allotment of minutes . The Sixers dropped to 1 - 22 and remain in last place in the Eastern Conference 's Atlantic Division with the worst record in the league . They head home for a date with the Detroit Pistons on Friday . The Nets used a 30 - 19 fourth quarter to come back from a 74 - 70 deficit entering the period . With Lopez spending large chunks of time on the bench , it was veteran big man Andrea Bargnani , making his return from a four - game absence due to a hamstring injury , that posted a season - high and game - high 23 points . Bargnani added six rebounds and an assist over a highly productive 23 minutes . Thaddeus Young was solid once again despite being without his customary frontcourt mate for a large part of the game , collecting his fourth consecutive double - double with 18 points and 11 rebounds . Bojan Bogdanovic pitched in with his second consecutive double - digit scoring game , amassing 10 points , three rebounds , and three assists , along with another pair of his trademark three - pointers . Like fellow reserve Bargnani , Shane Larkin also made significant contributions off the bench , tallying 14 points , six assists , four rebounds and a steal over an efficient and stat - sheet - stuffing 27 minutes . Brooklyn improved to 7 - 15 and remains in fourth place in the Eastern Conference 's Atlantic Division . They remain home for a Saturday afternoon showdown against the Clippers .

The Dallas Mavericks ( 16 - 13 ) won an overtime thriller Wednesday , 119 - 118 , against the host Brooklyn Nets ( 8 - 21 ) on an historic night for Dirk Nowitzki .

Oladipo was stellar again Friday , sharing the team lead with 20 points and adding nine rebounds , a pair of assists , three steals and a block . Considering his recent performances , the Magic will certainly have a good problem on their hands upon Payton 's return to health from his ankle injury , as they 'll be faced with trying to get a talented backcourt trio that also includes Evan Fournier sufficient playing time . Nikola Vucevic was Oladipo 's co - leading scorer on the night with a 20 - point , 10 - rebound double - double that also included four assists , a pair of steals and a block . Unsurprisingly , the productive outing came against a Nets defense that has allowed the most points per game ( 22 ) to opposing centers this season . Fournier made it three starters with double - digit scoring by tallying 13 points , which he supplemented with three assists , a rebound and a pair of steals . Aaron Gordon had an efficient 14 - point , five - rebound effort off the bench over 23 minutes to lead the Orlando reserves . The Magic improved to 20 - 17 and are currently in second place in the Eastern Conference 's Southeast Division . They head home to face the Wizards on Saturday . The Nets ' ninth straight home loss was due in large part to the suffocating defense of an Orlando unit ranked in the top 10 in points allowed per game ( 99 ) .

Joe Johnson continued his solid offensive play of late with a serviceable 13 points , three assists , three rebounds and a steal .

Holiday 's clutch 26 - foot three - pointer with four seconds remaining kept things interesting until the very end , and it was n't until McCollum drained two subsequent free throws with one second remaining that Portland was able to breathe easy .

Not a single member of the Pelicans original starting five suited up on Saturday , as each of them was dealing with various injuries . A brutally weakend starting lineup took the floor in New_Orleans , with career journeyman Alonzo Gee logging a team - high 41 minutes . As a whole , the team turned the ball over just seven times , an impressive feat against the stingy Toronto defense . Nevertheless , the team shot just 27 percent from deep and seemingly allowed everything on defense , as Toronto converted 53 percent of its shots . The Raptors will host the Thunder on Monday in a battle of two of the league 's top teams . The Pelicans , meanwhile , will see a less grueling matchup as they start next week off with a home game against the struggling Knicks .

Toronto 's outstanding defense has been one of the keys to their highly successful season , and their current position as the second seed in the Eastern Conference . However , it was their offense that made an early splash Friday , as Toronto jumped out to a 30 - 14 lead on the Celtics after one period . Because of their stinginess on the other side of the ball , falling behind by double digits to the Raptors is usually a death knell for most teams , and such was the case again Friday . Boston was forced into catch - up mode all night long , and could n't quite overtake Toronto despite playing much better in the second and third quarters .

Harden reverted back to shooting poorly from the field ( 6 - for - 22 ) , but was able to get to the line 17 times , converting on 14 tries . Marcus Thornton provided a nice scoring spark again , finishing with 18 points and a pair of three - point field goals . Orlando will head back home for a date with the undefeated Toronto Raptors in their next game , while Houston travels to Sacramento for a date with the 1 - 4 Kings .

The Houston Rockets ( 26 - 25 ) defeated the Miami Heat ( 27 - 22 ) 115 - 102 on Tuesday . Both clubs entered the game without their starting centers , but it was a tad more of an unexpected development for the home team . The Rockets found out earlier in the day that Dwight Howard had been suspended for Tuesday night 's game for making contact with an official while protesting a technical foul on Saturday versus the Wizards . With Clint Capela also sidelined with a left hip strain , veteran Josh Smith , reacquired earlier in the month from the Clippers , got the starting call versus Miami . His counterpart on the other side was a well - traveled veteran as well , as Amar'e Stoudemire took the court in Hassan Whiteside 's stead yet again due to the latter 's oblique injury . Both Smith and Stoudemire demonstrated why they 're still viable pieces of their respective squads , with the former coming second only to James Harden in scoring for Houston on the night , and the latter posting a double - double to help keep Miami close the majority of the contest . Ultimately , it was Harden 's remarkable effort , as well as the Rockets ' 52 and 46 percent tallies from the field and three - point range , respectively , that spearheaded the high - scoring victory . Miami was led by Luol Deng , who has come on offensively over the stretch that Whiteside has missed . He managed 17 points , eight rebounds , three assists and a steal . Dwyane Wade was right behind him with a 16 - point , four - rebound , four - assist effort that also included a steal and a block .

Stoudemire had 14 points of his own , which he supplemented with 10 boards and an assist . The starting five 's tally was rounded out by Chris Bosh , who supplied 13 points , seven rebounds , an assist and a block . Gerald Green pitched in with some scoring punch off the bench in leading the reserves , registering 13 points and adding four rebounds , three assists and a block . With the loss , the Heat fell a half - game back of the Atlanta Hawks for first place in the Eastern Conference 's Southeast Division . They remain in the state of Texas for a Wednesday night showdown with the Dallas Mavericks .

This was the Suns sixth loss in a row , while San_Antonio picked up their third win in a row . Given the Spurs undefeated home record and the poor play , injuries and drama surrounding the Suns , this game was pretty much over before it started .

The ball movement was superb as well , with San_Antonio recording 35 assists on 45 made baskets .

As a team , the Mavericks went 47 percent from the field and an impressive 48 percent from the three - point line , while the Knicks finished at 39 percent from the field and just 25 percent from deep . With Chandler Parsons ( knee ) still out , the Mavericks moved Wesley Matthews over to small forward , which gave Raymond Felton the opportunity to enter the starting lineup at shooting guard . Felton made the most of his opportunity and torched the Suns for a game - high of 18 points ( 7 - 14 FG , 2 - 3 3Pt , 2 - 2 FT ) , while also pitching in with six assists and four rebounds . Felton averaged just 4 points and 1 assists over 29 games with the Mavericks last season , so this was a fantastic performance for the guard . Deron Williams added 12 points ( 5 - 8 FG , 2 - 2 3Pt ) , six rebounds and an assist in his Mavericks ' debut . He had to leave the game in the third quarter with a left knee contusion , though , so we 'll have to wait and see if it forces him to miss any additional time . Dirk Nowitzki chipped in with 11 points ( 5 - 10 FG , 1 - 1 3Pt ) and nine rebounds as well . The Suns ' starting frontcourt trio of P.J. Tucker , Markieff Morris and Tyson Chandler really struggled in this one . They went a combined 3 - of - 11 from the field for just nine points , which clearly was the difference in this one . The backcourt combination of Brandon Knight and Eric Bledsoe was about all the Suns had going for them . Knight finished with 15 points ( 6 - 13 FG , 1 - 4 3Pt , 2 - 2 FT ) , six rebounds and three assists , while Bledsoe added 13 points ( 4 - 12 FG , 0 - 2 3Pt , 5 - 7 FT ) , four rebounds and four assists .

The Clippers have now lost four of their last five games The game started out close but Phoenix jumped out to a 20 point lead with a strong third quarter which the Clippers could not recover from . The Clippers were missing their starting back court as Chris Paul sat out with a sore right groin while J.J. Redick sat out with back spasms . The news only got worse for the Clippers as Blake Griffin was ejected after recieving his second technical foul near the end of the first half . Griffin played only 16 minutes and came up with 11 points , along with three rebounds and four assists . DeAndre Jordan was relatively quiet with only 11 points and nine rebounds .

Meanwhile , Bledsoe once again came very close to a triple double with 26 points , 10 rebounds and nine assists and has been looking great so far this season . The only other players to score double digits for the Suns were Jon Leuer who had 10 points and 11 rebounds , and T.J. Warren who scored 18 points on 7 - 10 shooting . The Suns as a team shot a strong 53 percent and did a good job on the defensive glass , not allowing the Clippers any second chances in this game .

The Milwaukee Bucks ( 11 - 18 ) defeated the Phoenix Suns ( 12 - 17 ) 101 - 95 on Sunday . The Bucks have been playing some bad basketball of late aside from their historic Golden State Warriors victory , but looked good today . Milwaukee really struggled at the free - throw line , but made up for it by shooting over 50 percent from the field . The second half is when the tides really turned , as the Bucks outscored the Suns by 14 over the final 24 minutes . The Bucks had to play this game without Giannis Antetokounmpo and it really didn’t effect them as much as expected . Khris Middleton and Michael Carter-Williams stepped up in his absence and put in some great lines . Middleton scored a team - high 26 points and dished out seven assists , while Carter-Williams tallied 20 points , nine rebounds and six assists . This is a frustrating team at times , but when they play the second half defense like they did today , they 're a tough team to beat . The Bucks have a good chance to add to this win when they host the Philadelphia 76ers on Wednesday for their next game . The Suns really struggled to get their potent offense going in this game and it 's evident through the stats . No player scored more than 18 points and the starters combined for just 52 points . T.J. Warren and Eric Bledsoe both scored a team - high 18 points and went a combined 9 - for - 9 from the free - throw line . The strange thing is that the starters took just 35 shots in the game and committed 12 turnovers . That 's a recipe for disaster and it was a miracle they kept it so close with those stats . Phoenix will look to bounce - back on Monday when they play the Utah Jazz .
The Phoenix Suns ( 15 - 24 ) defeated the Charlotte Hornets ( 17 - 18 ) 111 - 102 on Wednesday night . In a battle of two struggling teams , the home team prevailed in a much needed way . Phoenix came into this game in the midst of a nine - game losing streak and ended up pulling away with some good offense as a small underdog . They shot 49 percent from the field and went 19 - for - 33 from three - point range in a shooting exhibition . The benches were a huge disparity here , as the Suns bench has three players score 17 or more points , while the Hornets had only one bench player score more than five . The Hornets have now lost five - straight and they are now below .500 for the first time since the middle of November . It 's clear the injury to Nicolas Batum is really hurting this team , as they ca n't get anything going on either end of the floor . Kemba Walker has been playing at an all - time level recently though , but he ca n't do it all himself . He tallied 25 points , six assists and four rebounds in yet another great game . All five starters scored in double - figures actually , but they simply allowed the Suns to run up and down the floor on them far too often . Charlotte will look to end this slide on Saturday against the surging Los Angeles Clippers . The Suns needed a win as bad as any team in the NBA and they finally got one here . The amazing part is that they did it with defense , by holding the Hornets to 17 points in the final quarter . Brandon Knight was the star of the show , as he totaled 18 points , seven assists and three rebounds in the victory . The bench was fantastic as well , as T.J. Warren , Devin Booker , and Mirza Teletovic all scored between 17 and 19 points while combining for 21 rebounds , seven assists and four steals . Without Eric Bledsoe for the rest of the season , they need more team performances like this going forward in order to dig out of this deep hole they 've dug themselves . Phoenix 's next game will be on Friday when they host the Miami Heat in a difficult matchup .
The Indiana Pacers ( 23 - 19 ) defeated the Phoenix Suns ( 13 - 30 ) 97 - 94 on Tuesday night . In a game between two of the fastest - paced teams in the NBA , the offenses were downright ugly tonight . Indiana came into this game ticked off with their defensive form and it 's clear they were letting out their frustrations on this beaten up Suns team . The Pacers held the Suns to just 35 percent shooting and drew 22 turnovers in a dominant defensive performance . The NBA has become a three - point shooting league , but these teams set the league back a few years by combining to go 15 - for - 55 from long range in this game . The aggressive nature of Indiana can be emphasized by the fact that they recorded 16 steals in the victory . Indiana had lost four of their last five coming into this and a date with Phoenix is just what the doctor ordered . The Pacers didn’t play pretty basketball , but they got back to their roots and dominated with their stifling defense . The defensive total actually would have looked better if the Pacers didn’t allow 16 points in the final three minutes in a comeback effort . No player played spectacularly , but Paul George did put in a nice all - around game , as he tallied 19 points , eight rebounds , four assists and four steals in the win . Mighty Joe Young also gave the team a nice spark off the bench , as he finished with 11 points , three rebounds , five assists and two steals in just 19 minutes of action . Indiana will have to keep up this defensive form in their next game against the Golden State Warriors on Friday . This Suns team has fallen apart over the last two months and it 's quite clear that the offense is the main reason why . The amazing part about this game is that Phoenix shot 27 - for - 29 from the free - throw line and still barely cracked 90 points . That 's simply hard to do and it shows how inefficient they are playing right now . The one bright spot here was rookie Devin Booker , who scored a career - high 32 points in a shooting exhibition . Markieff Morris finally seemed to be turning things around over the last few games , but he left here in the first quarter with a shoulder injury . That 's the last thing this team needs , as the injuries are killing them right now . Brandon Knight really hurt his team tonight as well , as he went 2 - for - 9 from three - point range and committed a ghastly eight turnovers in the defeat . It doesn’t get much easier in their next game , as the Suns host the San Antonio Spurs on Thursday in what will likely be another lopsided result .
The Houston Rockets ( 27 - 25 ) narrowly defeated the struggling Suns ( 14 - 37 ) in Phoenix on Thursday , 111 - 105 . Corey Brewer unexpectedly provided a team - high 24 points for Houston , helping lead the balanced offensive effort the Rockets took in Phoenix . Superstar James Harden scored 17 points , below his average , but also pulled down nine rebounds and dished out six assists . Big man Dwight Howard , meanwhile , was not particularly present in the scoring column ( 5 points ) , but made his presence felt on the boards , tallying 16 rebounds on the night . Overall , Houston had a strong offensive showing , racking up points and hitting 15 three - pointers on the night . Phoenix has seen a steady plummet towards the bottom of the Western Conference following an injury to star point guard Eric Bledsoe . The team 's loss on Thursday was their 21st in 23 games . Despite holding major advantages at the line and on the boards , the Suns struggled offensively , recording 24 turnovers and shooting just 39 percent from the field . Even in the loss , however , rookie standout Devin Booker made himself known with 17 points and four assists . The Rockets will host the Portland Trail Blazers on Saturday . Phoenix next sees the court on Saturday as well , as the team will face off against the Utah Jazz .
The Oklahoma_City Thunder ( 39 - 14 ) defeated the Phoenix Suns ( 14 - 39 ) 122 - 106 on Monday . The high - octane Thunder got a bit more than they likely bargained for from a game Suns squad , beginning in the second period . After Oklahoma_City jumped out to a 28 - 19 lead after the first 12 minutes , Phoenix answered with a 38 - point second quarter in which they outscored the Thunder by nine . Entering the fourth quarter , the visitors clung to a surprisingly thin 89 - 85 lead . After P.J. Tucker sank a four - footer with 5:43 remaining , Phoenix had closed to within three , 99 - 96 . However , the Thunder scored seven of the next eight points , led by a pair of free throws apiece from Russell Westbrook and Kevin Durant . Although the Suns got as close as four points on one more occasion , Oklahoma_City pulled away over the final 3:47 to seal the harder - than - expected win . Durant led the charge for the Thunder with 32 points - - a scoring haul that included five three - pointers - - and added six rebounds , three assists , a steal and two blocks . Westbrook came close to one of his trademark triple - doubles , managing 29 points , eight rebounds , eight assists and two steals . The one blemish on his otherwise stellar outing was the six turnovers he committed . Dion Waiters pitched in with 15 points , four assists , three steals and a block . Enes Kanter and Cameron Payne paced the reserves with a pair of 11 - point efforts , with Kanter adding six rebounds and Payne registering four rebounds and four assists . Oklahoma_City remains atop the Western Conference 's Northwest Division . They 're back home on Thursday for a showdown with Anthony Davis and the New Orleans Pelicans . Phoenix 's attack was spearheaded by 23 points from a resurgent Markieff Morris . He also supplied seven rebounds , three assists , two steals and a block . However , like Westbrook , Morris was also guilty of handing the ball to the opposition on six occasions . Archie Goodwin continued his solid play as the starting point guard , managing 20 points , seven assists and four boards . Tucker amassed 16 points , five rebounds , two assists and five steals , while Tyson Chandler totaled 11 points , seven boards and a block . Mirza Teletovic paced the Phoenix reserves with 17 points , and also added an assist . Alex Len had a near double - double off the bench as well , registering 13 points , eight boards , two assists , two steals and a block . The Suns remain in fourth place in the Western Conference 's Pacific Division . They 're at home again Wednesday for another tussle with a high - powered offense , as the reigning champion Golden State Warriors come to town .
The San_Antonio Spurs ( 47 - 9 ) held off the Phoenix Suns ( 14 - 42 ) for a 118 - 111 win on Sunday . This was a much closer matchup than anticipated , with the Suns hanging around all game long . The game was actually tied with six minutes left , but the Spurs went on a 70 run from there to ultimately decide the game . San_Antonio 's three - point shooting was the key , as they went 10 - for - 16 from long distance in the victory . They also shot 52 percent from the field , while holding Phoenix to 46 percent on their end . San_Antonio hasn’t been playing impressively lately , but they continue to win games . This is the second game in a row where they allowed a double - digit underdog to hang around and score over 110 points . With that in mind , both of those games came without All-Star Kawhi Leonard . In this game , Tony Parker led the team with 22 points with Patty Mills scoring 21 of his own off the bench . LaMarcus Aldridge also played well , as he tallied 19 points and 10 rebounds en route to a double - double . The Spurs next game will be against the Sacramento Kings on Wednesday . Phoenix came into this matchup as a 14 - point underdog and nearly pulled out a miraculous win . Alex Len got the start for the injured Tyson Chandler and played great , double - doubling in a 23 - point , 13 - rebound performance . The bench was what kept the Suns around though , as Jon Leuer , Mirza Teletovic and Archie Goodwin all scored at least 13 points while combing for 18 total rebounds . On deck for the Suns is a matchup with the Los Angeles Clippers on Monday in the second half of a back - to - back set .
The Toronto Raptors ( 50 ) defeated the Oklahoma_City Thunder ( 3 - 2 ) 103 - 98 on Wednesday at Chesapeake Energy Arena in Oklahoma_City . After a back and forth battle over the first two quarters , the Raptors took a one - point lead into halftime . The Thunder then went off in the third quarter and gained some momentum , outscoring the Raptors 42 - 33 to take an eight - point lead . While the Thunder looked as if they were in control following that third quarter , the Raptors exploded in the fourth and pushed their way to a tough 103 - 98 victory on the road in Oklahoma_City . Overall , it was a relatively sloppy game , with the two teams combining for a whopping 34 turnovers . DeMar DeRozan had the hot hand for the Raptors , finishing with a game - high of 28 points ( 7 - 18 FG ) , to go along with five rebounds and three assists . He constantly forced his way to the free - throw line , hitting an impressive 14 - of - 15 attempts on the night . DeRozan is on a hot streak right now , combining for 48 points over his last two games and has been a huge reason the Raptors are still undefeated . Kyle Lowry also did his part Wednesday , contributing 17 points ( 5 - 14 FG , 3 - 8 3Pt , 4 - 6 FT ) , four rebounds , and one assist . After averaging eight assists coming into this outing , it was quite uncharacteristic of Lowry to only dish out the one dime . His five turnovers also matched a season - high . Jonas Valanciunas double - doubled with 17 points ( 6 - 9 FG , 5 - 5 FT ) and 11 rebounds over 29 minutes , which marked his second of the young season . The Thunder 's superstar duo of Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook did everything they could to push Oklahoma_City to a win . Durant finished an impressive 10 - for - 18 from the field and 2 - for - 5 from the three - point line for 27 points , while also adding seven rebounds and four assists . Offensively , Durant has been unstoppable to start this season , scoring 25 points or more in four of five games . Westbrook , on the other hand , nearly recorded the unconventional triple - double with 22 points ( 8 - 21 FG , 3 - 9 3Pt , 3 - 4 FT ) , 16 assists , and eight turnovers . The 16 assists were a season - high for the guard , although the eight turnovers were as well , so it was n't all good . Enes Kanter had a big day as well , pitching in 15 of the bench 's 22 points . The Raptors will next head to Orlando to play the Magic on Friday , while the Thunder will be on the road against the Chicago Bulls on Thursday .
The Oklahoma_City Thunder ( 30 - 12 ) defeated the Miami Heat ( 23 - 18 ) 99 - 74 , Sunday night at Chesapeake Energy Arena . The Heat were hurting coming into this game . Goran Dragic ( calf ) and Beno Udrih ( neck ) both sat out , leaving Dwyane Wade to start despite sore shoulders . Gerald Green also left the game with a sore knee . In addition to the injuries , this was the final game of a six - game road trip for Miami , during which they went 2 - 4 . On the contrary , the Thunder are at full strength and have been hot , especially at home . They have now won 10 of their last 12 , improved their home record to 20 - 5 and picked up their 30th win of the season . Kevin Durant was certainly not reaching when he said that he sees them as a legitimate title contender . After a close half , Oklahoma blew the game open with a 31 - 16 third quarter . Russell Westbrook logged his second straight triple - double , with 13 points , 15 assists and 10 rebounds , in 33 minutes . This was Westbrook 's fifth triple - double of the season and 24th of his career . Kevin Durant led the Thunder in scoring with 24 points , along with 10 rebounds for his own double - double . Serge Ibaka shot 9 - 15 on his way 19 points and grabbed seven rebounds , in 32 minutes . Miami struggled holding onto the ball , giving up 21 turnovers on the game . They also got out - rebounded and struggled shooting from deep . A tough spot in the schedule and injuries may have slowed them down , especially in the second half . Dwyane Wade finished with 22 points ( 9 - 15 FG ) , three assists and two rebounds , in 28 minutes . Tyler Johnson started at point guard and produced a nice 16 points ( 7 - 12 FG ) , six rebounds and four assists , in 38 minutes . Hassan Whiteside showed some offensive versatility , as he shot 7 - 9 on his way to 14 points . Whiteside also grabbed 11 rebounds and blocked four shots , in 33 minutes . The Heat will return home to host the Bucks , on Tuesday . They will then be embarking on another extended road trip . Miami will have to get back on track quickly in order to protect its position in the East . The Thunder will visit Denver to face off against the Nuggets on Tuesday . The Nuggets recently defeated the Warriors and therefore can not be taken lightly by opponent .
The Memphis Grizzlies ( 5 - 6 ) defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves ( 5 - 5 ) 114 - 106 on Sunday . Second-year Timberwolves point guard Zach LaVine had several breakout performances during his rookie campaign after starter Ricky Rubio went down for the season . Early in the 2015 - 16 campaign LaVine has once again benefited from Rubio 's injury troubles , and only foul trouble hindered him Sunday from potentially posting his best day as pro . LaVine tallied an incredible 25 points in just 17 minutes of court time , shooting 8 - for - 15 from the field , including 4 - for - 7 from three - point range . The scoring was LaVine 's second highest total of the season , and would have shattered his high - water mark of 26 points had his time on the court not been curtailed . Another pair of dynamic young Timberwolves , Andrew Wiggins and 2015 first overall pick Karl-Anthony Towns , stepped up offensively in their own right to lead Minnesota . Wiggins amassed 21 points , while Towns ( 14 points , nine boards ) came within a rebound short of a double - double for the second straight game . The Timberwolves also enjoyed an extremely balanced effort from their bench , with four players ( Shabazz Muhammad , Andre Miller , Nemanja Bjelica , and Gorgui Dieng ) all pitching with eight - point efforts . The Timberwolves fell to 5 - 5 and reside in fourth place in the Western Conference 's Northwest Division . They now head to Miami for a Tuesday tilt versus the Heat . The Grizzlies received a much - needed offensive boost from a somewhat unlikely source Sunday , as Jeff Green reentered the starting lineup with rousing success . Green poured in 21 points over a season - high 35 minutes on impressive 7 - of - 12 shooting . Meanwhile , Mike Conley continued to claw back from the low point of his season , a four - point , 1 - of - 12 shooting performance last Wednesday versus the Warriors . Conley tallied his first 20 - point effort since Nov. 7 , and chipped in seven assists and two steals . Frontcourt mates Marc Gasol and Zach Randolph had strong games of their own , with Gasol holding his own against the rookie sensation Towns to the tune of 16 points , seven rebounds , four assists , and a pair of blocks . Even new acquisition Mario Chalmers got into the act , pitching in 16 points off the bench over 18 minutes for his best game yet in a Grizzlies uniform . JaMychal Green also represented the Memphis reserves well , with a 12 - point outing . Memphis improved to 5 - 6 and resides in third place in the Western Conference 's Southwest Division . They head home for a date with the Oklahoma City Thunder on Monday .
In a down - to - the - wire game , the Orlando Magic ( 10 - 8 ) were able to pull out a win against the Minnesota Timberwolves ( 8 - 10 ) , finishing up 96 - 93 . Orlando is now in the Eastern Conference playoff picture , and the win against the Timberwolves marks the team 's fourth straight . Center Nikola Vucevic was a difference - maker for the Magic , recording a team - high 37 minutes and an 18 - point , 12 - rebound double - double . Orlando seemed to ride Vucevic 's hot hand all night , as he took a game - high 19 shots . The game also marked the continuation of shooting guard Victor Oladipo 's new role as a sixth man , a change that seems to have benefited Orlando 's rotations . Oladipo followed up a 19 - point outing off the bench against Boston with 13 points tonight to go with four rebounds , four assists , and three steals . All in all , the Magic appear to be clicking , as they now have a substantial win streak and sit two games above .500 . For the Timberwolves , meanwhile , the close loss saw some unorthodox rotations from coach Sam Mitchell . As rookie center Karl-Anthony Towns struggled from the field ( 2 - for - 11 ) , backup big man Gorgui Dieng stepped in to play a season - high 29 minutes . Dieng looked solid defensively , recording three blocks and a steal while also playing efficient offense , tallying 11 points on 4 - of - 6 shooting . The Louisville alum has seen a steady uptick in minutes recently , and with his elevated play , this could be a continuing trend in the crowded Minnesota frontcourt . With four straight wins under their belt , the Magic will hope to extend the streak even further as they face the Jazz on Thursday . Meanwhile , the Timberwolves will look to bounce back on Saturday as they prepare to square off against Portland .
The Oklahoma_City Thunder ( 27 - 12 ) defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves ( 12 - 27 ) 101 - 96 on Tuesday night . This was a major mismatch on paper , but this game was closer than expected . Minnesota actually made a huge run in the fourth quarter to nearly cap off a double - digit comeback . What killed Minnesota once again were it 's starters , as they amassed just 41 points between the five of them . That 's actually less points than Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook combined who scored 52 of their own . The Thunder have been one of the best teams in the NBA since December and that continued here . They got out to an early double - digit lead and never looked back after that . Westbrook and Durant once again carried the load , as they combined for 52 points , 14 rebounds and 14 assists in the win . Enes Kanter continued his fantastic bench production , as he scored 18 points in less than 20 minutes of action . It 's quite bizarre actually , considering Kanter is ranked as one of the 10 best big men in the NBA on a per - minute rate . They simply need to get him some more minutes if the Thunder want to get to their full potential . Oklahoma_City 's next game will be on Wednesday against the Dallas Mavericks . The Timberwolves are easily one of the worst home teams in the NBA , but they played well here . They are now just 5 - 17 at Target Center and it 's a wonder why such a young team is so bad in their home arena . In any case , most of their youngsters played great here , as Shabazz Muhammad , Zach LaVine and Andrew Wiggins all scored at least 20 points . LaVine put in the most impressive line , as he accumulated 21 points , nine rebounds and four assists in one of his best games of the season . Minnesota will look to get out of this slump in their next game when they take on the Houston Rockets on Wednesday .
The Phoenix Suns ( 13 - 29 ) saw their woes continue on Sunday after being blown out 117 - 87 by the Minnesota Timberwolves ( 13 - 29 ) . While the Suns ' slide continued , the Timberwolves were able to turn their recent bad luck around . Coming into Sunday 's matchup , the Wolves had dropped 13 of their last 14 games . One would not have guessed that based on Sunday 's game , however , as the Timberwolves shot 57 percent from the field while out - rebounding the Suns 41 - 30 . The Wolves also had a huge advantage at the free - throw line , knocking down 31 of a whopping 40 free - throw attempts as opposed to the Suns ' paltry 14 for 25 . Minnesota 's pair of first - overall picks shone brightly in just 50 combined minutes , with Andrew Wiggins delivering 18 points to go with four assists and four rebounds and Karl-Anthony Towns going for 14 points , eight rebounds , and three blocks . The Suns now stand in a similar position to Minnesota , having lost 13 of their last 14 . Phoenix 's downward spiral has been due in large part to star point guard Eric Bledsoe 's season - ending meniscus injury . The guard was averaging 20 points per game and also sat in the top 10 in the NBA in steals per game prior to his injury . On Sunday , the team simply failed to click on all levels , shooting just 43 percent including a disastrous 20 percent from beyond the arc . Phoenix had major issues with ball movement , racking up just 16 assists on the night . The Suns ' next matchup will be against the Indiana Pacers on Tuesday . Minnesota , meanwhile , will travel to New Orleans on Tuesday to take on the Pelicans .
The New_York Knicks ( 24 - 33 ) defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves ( 17 - 39 ) 103 - 95 on Saturday . The Knicks got off to a hot start here and stepped on the Wolves throats early . It was the first and third quarters that really propelled them , as the Knicks outscored the Timberwolves by 24 points in that 24 - minute span . The rebounding was key , as New_York snatched down 51 rebounds to Minnesota 's 31 . The Knicks also shot 51 percent from the field , while holding the Timberwolves to 43 percent shooting . New_York has really been struggling recently , so this was a much needed win . Carmelo Anthony led the team with 30 points , while also providing 11 rebounds and four assists . Robin Lopez was a huge spark , as he totaled 26 points and 16 rebounds in one of his best performances of the season . No player totaled more than four assists , so it was a lot of ISO ball that got it done for the Knicks . Up next for New_York is a matchup against the Toronto Raptors on Monday . Minnesota did a great job of fighting late , but dug themselves too deep of a hole to come back . They outscored the Knicks by 12 in the final quarter , while amassing 34 points . Karl Anthony-Towns was the best player , as he accumulated 24 points , eight rebounds , four assists and three blocks in the defeat . Ricky Rubio did a great job of distributing , dishing out 16 assists in the loss . On deck for Minnesota is the Boston Celtics on Tuesday .
The Portland Trail_Blazers ( 8 - 12 ) took the lead with a 41 - point third quarter Thursday night against the Indiana Pacers ( 12 - 6 ) and held on for the 123 - 111 victory at the Moda Center . Trail_Blazers guard Damian Lillard scored 11 of his 26 points in the third quarter . With 6:52 remaining in the period , Lillard knocked down one of his five three - pointers of the game to give Portland a 74 - 71 lead , a lead they would not relinquish . Lillard 's 26 points led Portland , and his eight assists were a game high . Backcourt mate C.J. McCollum added 21 points , five rebounds and five assists . Allen Crabbe tied his career high set on Tuesday with 18 points off the bench . He shot 4 - 5 from three - point land , helping the Trail_Blazers shoot a robust 18 - 36 from deep on the night . Pacers guard C.J. Miles caught fire from three as well , as he poured in 27 points to lead Indiana , fueled by eight three - pointers . George Hill scored 18 points and Ian Mahinmi notched a double - double with 10 points and 11 rebounds , but Pacers superstar Paul George was quiet , scoring 11 on a poor 4 - 17 shooting night . Despite shooting 43 percent from three , the Pacers shot just 43 percent from the floor overall . Indiana will look to rebound Saturday night against the Jazz in Utah . Portland 's next game comes on the road at Minnesota on Saturday .
The Portland Trail_Blazers ( 16 - 24 ) defeated the Oklahoma_City Thunder ( 26 - 12 ) 115 - 110 on Sunday . The Thunder shot the ball more efficiently than the Blazers and looked to rip off a strong run behind the highest scoring duo in Russell Westbrook and Kevin Durant , but the high power offense came up just short , as Damian Lillard drained back - to - back 3 - pointers late in the 4th quarter . While Durant was heating up , primarily on strong ball movement lead by Westbrook , the Thunder tried to pull away by double - digits in the 3rd and 4th quarters , but the Blazers simply hung around for long enough to turn the momentum in their favor . Oklahoma_City received almost the entirety of their offense from the starters , as the bench provided a lowly 16 points combined from Dion Waiters , Enes Kanter and Cameron Payne . Kevin Durant led the Thunder with 28 points , to go along with six rebounds and four assists , while Russell Westbrook added 25 points , 15 assists ( 10 dimes in the first half ) and nine rebounds . Steven Adams hauled in a double - double , as he contributed 17 points and 10 rebounds , while Serge Ibaka and Andre Roberson finished in double - figures to round out the starting five . Billy Donovan did not rely on his bench and only Dion Waiters eclipsed 20 - plus minutes on a reserved role , as the starters all played 30 - plus minutes in the contest . The Thunder will continue their road trip when they visit the Minnesota Timberwolves ( 12 - 26 ) on Tuesday . Damian Lillard did not back down from the difficult matchup against Russell Westbrook , and knocked down the game tying and go ahead 3 - pointers to earn the comeback win . The Blazers were battling uphill throughout the majority of the game and it came behind sub - 40 percent shooting through three quarters of play . The 4th quarter was an entirely different story , and when Lillard gets a hot hand , he can be one of the deadliest deep ball shooters in the league . The all star point guard finished with 31 points on 9 - of - 18 shooting ( 8 - of - 14 from 3 - point territory ) , to go along with seven rebounds and nine assists . C.J. McCollum poured in 22 points to aid the scoring , adding four 3 - pointers of his own . Mason Plumlee pitched in 11 points and 11 rebounds , while Allen Crabbe and Ed Davis ( knee ) contributed double figures from the bench . Portland has been one of the bigger surprises this season , after many predicted them to have one of the league’s worst records after the departure of LaMarcus Aldridge , the Blazers improved to 9 - 9 at home and are approaching 20 wins before the all - star break . The Blazers will host the Utah Jazz ( 17 - 20 ) on Wednesday .
The Portland Trail_Blazers ( 37 - 35 ) defeated the Dallas Mavericks ( 36 - 35 ) 109 - 103 on Wednesday . After a 132 - 120 overtime defeat on Sunday in Dallas , the Trail_Blazers came in to Wednesday looking to turn the tables . Priority one was likely putting the clamps on ageless veteran Dirk Nowitzki , who had scorched them for a season - high 40 points just three nights prior . Portland did a much more effective job Wednesday , holding the Mavs power forward to 21 points , nine rebounds , three assists and a block . Wesley Matthews did have one of his more effective nights of the season against his former teammates while posting 22 points , but Damian Lillard and the rest of the Trail_Blazers starting five proved too much for the visitors . Matthews ' scoring total did pace Dallas , and he added five rebounds , an assist , two steals and a block . Salah Mejri put together another impressive outing in a second straight start , tallying a 14 - point , 12 - rebound double - double that also included an assist , a steal and a block . Deron Williams followed with his own double - double , managing 12 points , 11 assists , four rebounds and a steal . J.J. Barea paced the reserves with 14 points , five assists , two rebounds and a steal . Devin Harris was also effective off the bench , totaling 11 points , four rebounds and a pair of steals . The Mavericks remain in third place in the Western Conference 's Southwest Division , and are currently slotted in the seventh seed as well . They head to Oakland to take on the Golden State Warriors on Friday night . Lillard 's game - high 27 points spearheaded the Portland attack , and he complemented it with six rebounds , six assists , two blocks and a steal . He did commit seven turnovers , the only blemish on his otherwise stellar performance . Ed Davis was next with a bench - leading 16 points , which he supplemented with nine rebounds , two assists and three steals . C.J. McCollum and Maurice Harkless followed with a pair of 14 - point efforts . McCollum also dished out four assists and hauled in a rebound , while Harkless posted four rebounds , two assists , a steal and a block .

The Trail_Blazers remain in second place in the Western Conference 's Northwest Division , and are currently slotted in the sixth seed as well . They head to Los Angeles to take on the Clippers on Thursday night .
The Warriors got off to a strong start in defense of their title Tuesday night , claiming a resounding 111 - 95 victory over the Pelicans . New_Orleans was already in a tough spot before the game even started , as six players ( Omer Asik , Tyreke Evans , Jrue Holliday , Luke Babbitt , Quincy Pondexter , and Norris Cole ) were ruled out , leaving just nine players available . To make matters worse , the Pelicans would later lose Dante Cunningham to a possible concussion . The pressure of keeping the Pelicans afloat fell squarely on Anthony Davis , who shot a woeful 4 - for - 20 from the field to finish with 18 points in what amounted to one of the worst games of his young career . A 17 - point , 10 - assist outburst off the bench by the recently signed Ish Smith enabled the Pelicans to stay within shouting distance by halftime , but the Warriors extended their lead to 19 by the end of the third quarter to put the came out of reach . Leading the Golden_State attack was league MVP Stephen Curry , who came out guns blazing in the first 12 minutes . He set a personal - best mark in first quarter scoring with 24 points , and didn’t cool off much from there , ending the night with 40 points and seven assists on 14 - for - 24 shooting . Curry’s electrifying performance made up for quiet offensive nights from fellow starters Klay Thompson , Harrison Barnes , and Draymond Green , but the trio certainly made their presence felt . Green in particular was a notable performer , as he was responsible for shadowing Davis most of the night . The Pelicans will look to right the ship when they head north to Portland on Wednesday for the second game of a back - to - back , while the Warriors will enjoy two days off before they meet up with the Rockets in Houston in a rematch of last year’s Western Conference Finals .

The Golden_State Warriors ( 180 ) would not have their record tarnished by the lowly Sacramento Kings ( 6 - 12 ) as they came up with the 120 - 101 win on Saturday night , in Oakland . The Kings started out well as they put up a competitive first quarter but could not keep up with the high - paced , high - efficiency Warriors . Sacramento was missing DeMarcus Cousins again , who is still out with a sore back . Rudy Gay led the way for the Kings with 20 points scored on 7 - 20 shooting , he also pulled down seven boards , in a limited 27 minutes . Kosta Koufos started in place of Cousins and put up a decent 14 points on 7 - 13 shooting , along with seven rebounds . Omri Casspi chipped in 11 points and seven rebounds in 28 minutes . The Kings as a team shot only 39 percent from the field . Golden_State fielded a balanced offense and played as a cohesive unit with an amazing 32 assists on 39 made field goals .

The Golden_State Warriors ( 26 - 1 ) held off the Milwaukee Bucks ( 10 - 18 ) to eek out a surprising 121 - 112 win on Friday . Most people had this pegged as a Warriors blowout in a revenge situation , but it was far from that . Milwaukee came out with some fire and took an early 12 - point lead going into the half and nearly held off the Warriors for an unlikely win . The Bucks made some lineup changes and the whole team played extremely well , shooting 60 percent from the field in the first half and 47 percent for the game . Both teams continually got to the free - throw line in the game as well , as the Bucks went 24 - for - 28 from the charity stripe while Golden_State went 28 - for - 37 . The Warriors really took it to them in the fourth quarter though , as they outscored them 36 - 19 to run away with the win . Milwaukee ended the Warriors 24 - game winning streak last week and appear to have the Dubs number . They got some great performances all - around , as seven players scored in double - figures . Greg Monroe made a shocking return to the lineup and flirted with a 10 point - 13 rebound - seven assist triple - double . Michael Carter-Williams also returned to the starting - five and tallied 24 points , four rebounds and four assists in the loss . This team has simply been bad this year and it 's hard to figure why they play so well against the best team in the NBA . They 'll look to build off this performance against the Phoenix Suns on Sunday in their next scheduled game . The Warriors just ca n't figure out this Bucks team and it 's just one of those phenomenons that’s hard to understand . Steph Curry and Draymond Green both flirted with triple - doubles and carried the Warriors in their win . Curry accumulated 26 points , 10 rebounds and nine assists , while Green amassed 21 points , nine rebounds and eight assists . This was a close call , but the versatility and grittiness of this team is hard to match . Golden_State will have a few days off until they host the Utah Jazz on Wednesday in their next game .
The Golden_State Warriors ( 29 - 1 ) defeated the Sacramento Kings ( 12 - 19 ) 122 - 103 on Monday . A wild and event filled night went down at Oracle Arena , as Stephen Curry went lights out for a three minute span that included 17 points in the last three minutes of the first half . DeMarcus Cousins highlighted the second half of play , and was ejected after arguing his fifth foul of the night , leading to a technical foul call followed by an early exit .

Klay Thompson poured in 29 points and Draymond Green added 25 points of his own , as the Warriors big three contributed over 60 percent of the team 's points . At this point of the season , we have grown accustomed to the Warriors impressive 3 - point shooting , and tonight was no different , as Golden_State shot 48 percent from deep as a unit . While the loss of Cousins dealt a major blow to the Kings’ chances in the second half , they did play competitively in the first half and through Curry’s hot streak . Omri Casspi went for a career high 36 points , including Curry like 3 - pointers from 32 - plus feet , and finished 9 - of - 12 from deep . Casspi’s impressive night was the spark Sacramento needed to compete without their all star center . Rajon Rondo got into foul trouble early , picking up three in the first quarter and played a total of 17 minutes . Rondo finished with four points and two assists , far below his season averages . Rudy Gay contributed 17 points , while Darren Collison did his best to aid the bench , adding 13 points , 11 assists and six rebounds .

The Golden_State Warriors ( 41 - 4 ) defeated the San_Antonio Spurs ( 38 - 7 ) 120 - 90 at Oracle Arena on Monday . The most anticipated matchup of the season resulted in a surprising 30 - point rout in favor of the Warriors . The first of four regular season matchups between the NBA’s two best teams started off shaky for San_Antonio , as they converted eight turnovers in the first quarter , and never truly recovered over the next three periods . The turnovers started at the expense of Tony Parker , the 15 year veteran who uncharacteristically made bad passes , was out played by Stephen Curry on the defensive end . Kawhi Leonard was eventually switched to guard the reigning MVP , but was as unsuccessful as Parker in trying to slow down Curry . Leonard led the Spurs in scoring and finished with 16 points on 4 - of - 6 shooting , to go along with five rebounds and two assists . David West started in place of Tim Duncan ( knee ) , and also finished in double - figures with 12 points . LaMarcus Aldridge was unable to get comfortable in the post , Boris Diaw faced difficulty getting space and Manu Ginobili was equally ineffective from behind the arc and on the drive . The loss snapped a 13 game winning streak for San_Antonio . The Spurs will look to bounce back when they host the Houston Rockets ( 25 - 22 ) on Wednesday . The Warriors did not disappoint in their own arena , and were more impressive on the defensive end of the floor as compared to their high powered offense . While Golden_State dropped 120 points , they harassed the Spurs and forced 26 turnovers which led to an early first half lead , in which they did not let go of the rest of the game . The quickness of the Warriors offense caused constant mismatches , especially in the paint after the drive , where Shaun Livingston was the first to wreck havoc in transition . Livingston’s 13 points were mostly seen in the second quarter . Stephen Curry was far from quiet and started to heat up where Livingston left off , as he scored 37 points on 12 - of - 20 shooting , including six three - pointers in 28 minutes . Draymond Green commanded the offense during many of the Warriors possessions , as a result , he rounded out the box score with 11 points , nine rebounds and six assists . Six Warriors players finished in double figures with no one player going for more than 28 minutes , as the lead in the fourth quarter was comfortable enough to run the reserves . The win marks the fourth straight for Golden_State . The Warriors will host the Dallas Mavericks ( 25 - 21 ) , one of the only teams to beat them this season , on Wednesday .
The Golden_State Warriors ( 47 - 4 ) defeated the Houston Rockets ( 27 - 27 ) 123 - 110 on Tuesday night . The Warriors got off to a hot start , as they scored 42 points in the first quarter to take a 15 - point lead . They never really looked back after that despite allowing the Rockets to crawl back in the third quarter . Golden_State shot 47 percent from the field and recorded 28 assists on their 44 made baskets . The game was tied heading into the fourth quarter , but the Warriors outscored the Rockets 30 to 17 over the final 12 minutes . Houston had a tough task here as a double - digit underdog , but did a good job of hanging around all night . James Harden once again carried the load , as he tallied 37 points , five rebounds , five assists and three steals in the loss . Dwight Howard also played well , as he double - doubled in a 16 - point , 15 - rebound performance . The Rockets have a quick turnaround , as they play the Portland Trail Blazers on Wednesday in the second half of a back - to - back set . The Warriors didn’t play their cleanest game , but they extended their undefeated home winning streak to 23 games on the season . Steph Cwas the catalyst once again , as he accumulated 35 points , nine assists and five rebounds in the win . Andrew Bogut was the darkhorse hero though , as he double - doubled while also recording six blocks and three steals in a defensive showcase . Golden_State 's last game before the All-Star break will be on Wednesday when they play the Phoenix Suns .
The Golden_State Warriors ( 54 - 5 ) defeated the Atlanta Hawks ( 33 - 28 ) 109 - 105 in OT at Oracle Arena on Tuesday . Shaun Livingston started in place of the injured Stephen Curry ( ankle ) , but the absence of Curry was felt tremendously on the court . Add Andre Iguodala ( hamstring ) being ruled out , and the Warriors found themselves in a thin situation on both the offensive and defensive ends of the court . The game itself was a thriller and Golden_State needed an extra five minutes to pull out an impressive and gutsy performance to stay undefeated on their home court . With 1:0 left to play in the fourth quarter , Paul Millsap made his way to the free throw line , where he sank two baskets to take a two point lead , but Klay Thompson drove the lane on the ensuing possession and matched Millsap 's free throws to tie the game at 97 points each . Both Millsap and Andrew Bogut missed on their chance to win the game in regulation . Overtime went in favor of the Warriors , where Draymond Green stepped up to the challenge and salvaged a broken play with a quick fire three pointer as the shot clock expired , which all but put the nail in the coffin for the Hawks . Green finished with 15 points , 13 rebounds and eight assists on 6 - of - 15 shooting , while Klay Thompson led Golden_State in scoring with 26 points , although it came on the back of 27 shots . Bogut’s last second attempt to win in regulation prevented an almost perfect night of shooting , as he totaled 19 points on 8 - of - 9 shooting . Leandro Barbosa was the bench hero the Warriors needed during multiple plays , rolling off screens and creating off the dribble on multiple occasions . Barbosa’s 11 points were not of the volume type , but they all came at crucial moments in the game . The Hawks may have been considered lucky that they did not have to face the reigning MVP , but they also dealt with a deep Golden_State team that boasts the best record in the league . The defensive sets seemed to trump Steve Kerr’s squad , especially after taking the lead in the fourth quarter . Six Hawks players finished in double figures , but 17 team turnovers would eventually become their downfall . Paul Millsap led all Atlanta scorers with 19 points , to go along with seven rebounds and four assists , while Al Horford contributed 17 points , nine rebounds and three assists in the effort . Dennis Schroder outplayed Jeff Teague off the bench , scoring 17 points and dishing out nine assists in 28 minutes . The Warriors listed Curry as questionable for the anticipated matchup against the Oklahoma City Thunder ( 42 - 18 ) on Thursday , while the Hawks will look to bounce back when they visit the Los Angeles Lakers ( 12 - 49 ) on Friday .
The Boston Celtics ( 44 - 32 ) shocked the Golden_State Warriors ( 68 - 8 ) in a 109 - 106 win on Friday . The loss snapped the Warriors ' NBA-record 54 consecutive home winnning streak . The key for Boston was its defense , as it held the Warriors to 46 percent shooting and forced 22 turnovers . The Celtics shot 47 percent from the field , despite hitting only 63 percent of their free - throws . Boston has quietly been one of the best teams in the league this season , but they 're not so hidden anymore . Evan Turner filled in for Jae Crowder and tallied 21 points , five rebounds , five assists and three steals in a great performance . Isaiah Thomas led the team with 22 points , while also dishing out six assists , Jared Sullinger was huge down low , as he amassed 21 points and 12 rebounds . Up next for the Celtics is a matchup with the Los Angeles Lakers on Sunday . Golden_State is now a 5 - 1 stretch away from breaking the record for wins in a season , so this was obviously a huge blow for that pursuit . Steph Curry scored 22 points in the third quarter , but really struggled aside from that . In fact , Curry had just seven points in the other three quarters and committed nine turnovers in the defeat . Draymond Green had another great all - around game though , as he accumulated 16 points , nine rebounds , seven assists and six steals . On deck for the Warriors is a matchup with the Portland Trail Blazers on Sunday .
In a battle of squads missing key players , the Washington Wizards ( 4 - 4 ) topped the Orlando Magic ( 5 - 6 ) 108 - 99 . Washington was without breakout shooting guard Bradley Beal ( shoulder ) , leaving a void in the starting lineup to be filled by Garrett Temple . The absence of Beal 's outside shooting was more than made up for , however , as the Wizards shot 43 percent from beyond the arc , including five made three - pointers from power forward Kris Humphries . Third-year forward Otto Porter Jr. also shone for the Wizards , recording four steals and finishing a team - high plus - 20 on the night . Orlando was also missing their starting shooting guard , as third - year star Victor Oladipo sat the contest out with a concussion . With a hole left at shooting guard , 23 - year - old Evan Fournier picked up the slack , recording a team - high 37 minutes and tallying 18 points . Center Nikola Vucevic was also able to exploit the thin Washington frontcourt , recording a 19 - point , 13 - rebound double - double . With the win , the Wizards improve their record to 4 - 4 . They will hope to rise above .500 as they take on the Bucks on Tuesday in Washington . The Magic , meanwhile , will look to even out the win and loss columns at home on Wednesday against the Timberwolves .
The Indiana Pacers ( 9 - 5 ) defeated the Washington Wizards ( 6 - 5 ) 123 - 106 on Tuesday . Hey Warriors , there’s a new offensive juggernaut on the block , albeit an unlikely one . After tallying a season - high 123 points in a resounding trouncing of the Milwaukee Bucks on Saturday , the Indiana Pacers turned right around and matched that total in an impressive road win over the Wizards . The outstanding offensive effort was spearheaded by the record - breaking performances of Paul George ( 40 points , eight rebounds , four assists and two steals ) and C.J. Miles ( 32 points , three rebounds , three assists and a steal ) , who were a combined 15 - for - 17 from three - point range . Both players also set individual season - bests in made shots from the beyond the arc , with Miles draining eight long - range buckets , and George posting seven treys of his own . In total , the game featured an astounding 32 three - pointers , with the Pacers tallying 19 of those . Indiana didn’t need a whole lot more than George’s and Miles’ contributions , considering they accounted for well over half of the team’s scoring . However , they did receive double - digit scoring efforts from Monta Ellis ( 10 points , five assists , five rebounds ) and the returning George Hill ( 14 points , five assists , four rebounds ) . Center Ian Mahinmi came within a rebound of his second double - double of the season , collecting seven points and hauling in nine boards . The Pacers improved to 9 - 5 and currently reside in third place in the Eastern Conference’s Central Division . They head home for a Friday showdown with the Bulls . The Wizards benefited from Bradley Beal’s first game with at least 20 points since a Nov. 6 contest versus the Celtics . The shooting guard amassed 20 points , four rebounds , three assists and two steals . John Wall , as he has been prone to do occasionally this season , struggled with turnovers , committing a season - high eight over 31 minutes . He did manage a season - best three buckets from beyond the arc on his way to an 18 - point , four - rebound , five - assist outing . Like his Pacers’ counterpart Mahinmi , Marcin Gortat also came a rebound short of a double - double performance ( 10 points , nine boards ) , while Kris Humphries ( scoreless over nine minutes ) and Otto Porter ( seven points , three rebounds , three assists ) did very little to help Washington’s cause . Gary Neal enjoyed a momentous night off the bench , leading the team with 23 points and sinking five three - pointers . The Wizards fell to 6 - 5 and currently reside in third place in the Eastern Conference’s Southeast Division . They head to Charlotte for a Wednesday showdown versus the Hornets .
The Clippers ( 19 - 13 ) put an end to the Wizards ' ( 14 - 15 ) hot streak with a 108 - 91 victory at Verizon Center on Monday . The big story for the Clippers has been the absence of forward Blake Griffin , who is out at least two weeks with a quad injury . The thing is , Los_Angeles does n't seem to be missing Griffin that much after a third straight win - - second with Griffin sidelined . The Clippers jumped out to a commanding lead in the first quarter behind Chris Paul , who finished with a team - high 23 points and seven assists . Center DeAndre Jordan also stepped up big with Griffin out , pouring in 15 points with 13 rebounds , though Los_Angeles lost the battle on the boards 45 to 37 . In the end , Paul was able to get the best of John Wall , who managed to score 23 points , but disappeared late in the game in going scoreless in the fourth quarter . Despite the late - game struggles , Wall still dished out 11 assists and has posted six consecutive double - doubles . Otto Porter Jr. finally looked healthy , scoring 21 points on 8 - of - 12 shooting with three 3 - pointers and eight rebounds over 33 minutes . Porter Jr. had only played 19 minutes in the Wizards ' previous game and had missed three prior to that while dealing with a thigh injury . The unsung hero of the night for the Clippers was Jamal Crawford , who is known to rise to the occasion throughout his career . He came off the bench to score 21 points on 9 - of - 12 shooting and three treys to provide some extra scoring punch behind Paul and Jordan . Other role players also stepped up ; Cole Aldrich had his best game of the season with 13 points , six rebounds , four steals and three assists in 20 minutes , while Wesley Johnson added 14 points .
The Washington Wizards ( 18 - 19 ) defeated the Milwaukee Bucks ( 16 - 25 ) 106 - 101 on Wednesday . On the same day that the Wizards welcomed back one key starter that they 'd notably missed over the last month , they received bad news on another key component of their squad . Wednesday night saw the return of Bradley Beal after he was sidelined 16 games with a lower leg injury . However , the team also learned earlier in the day that Marcin Gortat had developed an infection in his ailing knee , and would be sidelined for a second consecutive game . His defensive presence was particularly missed , as the Wizards managed to escape with a hard - fought victory despite the Bucks getting the better of them down low , and also outscoring them in the third quarter , 31 - 15 . Both Greg Monroe and Giannis Antetokoumpo managed double - doubles , and Milwaukee outrebounded Washington on the defensive glass by the considerable margin of 37 - 9 . They also outscored the Wizards in the paint , 62 - 38 , two figures that likely would have been drastically different had Gortat 's stout defense been in between the Bucks and the basket . Milwaukee was led by another outstanding performance from Khris Middleton , who has truly come into his own and hit his stride offensively . The 24 - year - old tallied a game - high 25 points and added five rebounds , five assists and two steals , the fourth time in the last five games he 's scored 20 or more points . Monroe took advantage of a clearer path down low in Gortat 's absence , managing 21 points , 12 rebounds , an assist and a pair of steals . Antetokounmpo was right behind him with his own 19 - point , 11 - rebound effort that also included six assists , two steals and a block . Even second - year pro Jabari Parker got in on the fun , posting a season - high 22 points and supplementing it with six rebounds , an assist and a steal . The Bucks fell to 16 - 25 and remain in last place in the Eastern Conference 's Central Division . They now head back home and await the Atlanta Hawks for a Friday showdown . The Wizards enjoyed double - digit scoring nights from each of their five starters , who were unsurprisingly led by John Wall . The All-Star point guard collected 19 points , eight assists , five rebounds , a steal and a block . Jared Dudley was next in line with a 13 - point , six - rebound outing , and took away the ball three times on the night as well . Nene Hilario did a solid job in Gortat 's stead for the second straight contest , pitching in with 12 points , three assists , two rebounds and two blocks . He also had a trio of thefts , in what would become somewhat of a running theme throughout the game . Garrett Temple , likely starting his last game in place of Beal , was solid with 11 points , five assists , four rebounds and a block , while amassing five steals as well . Otto Porter rounded things out for the first unit with 10 points , two rebounds , an assist and a steal . Ramon Sessions paced the reserves with 15 points , five assists and a rebound over a highly efficient 22 minutes , and Beal looked good while pouring in 11 points , hauling three rebounds , dishing out three assists and also collecting a steal . In total , Washington was able to induce a whopping 27 turnovers from Milwaukee , which they converted into 36 points . Washington improved to 18 - 19 and moved into fourth place in the Eastern Conference 's Southeast Division . They now head to Indiana to face the Pacers on Friday .
The Washington Wizards ( 28 - 30 ) defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers ( 41 - 17 ) 113 - 99 on Sunday . LeBron James was given an off day for only the second time this season and unfortunately for the Cavs , the results of his absence were somewhat predictable . The final margin of victory for the Wizards belied their game - long dominance of Cleveland , who was already staring at a 96 - 70 deficit heading into the final period . Washington 's first unit unsurprisingly bested Cleveland 's starting five in all major categories , and only Kyrie Irving appeared determined to try and keep the game respectable for the short - handed visitors . The victory was a crucial one for a Wizards squad that needs every win it can get down the stretch , and the comfortable second - half lead allowed their front - line players some much needed rest . All five members of the first unit were able to play under 30 minutes for the Wizards , a welcome luxury in the latter stages of what has been a tough season for them to date . Irving 's 28 points spearheaded Cleveland 's attack on the afternoon , and the game - high scoring total was supplemented by six assists and a rebound . Kevin Love was a distant second with 12 points , five rebounds and an assist in just 24 minutes of play . Veteran Richard Jefferson drew the start in James ' place , and contributed 10 points , five boards and an assist . Tristan Thompson ( two points , two rebounds , two assists ) and J.R. Smith ( eight points , four rebounds , an assist and two steals ) were underwhelming while rounding out a generally forgettable afternoon for the Cavs ' first unit . Timofey Mozgov contributed a 10 - point , 10 - rebound double - double off the bench to pace the reserves . Despite the defeat , the Cavs continue atop the Eastern Conference Central Division and also possess the first seed in the conference by one and a half games over the Toronto Raptors , who can make up some ground by defeating the Detroit Pistons later Sunday . Cleveland heads back home to face off against the Indiana Pacers on Monday evening . John Wall led the way for Washington with 21 points , 13 assists and seven rebounds in just 29 minutes . Otto Porter encouragingly matched Wall 's point total and added five rebounds , three assists and a block . It was notably only the second performance of over 20 points for the struggling forward in February , and first since Feb. 6 versus the Hornets . Marcin Gortat contributed a near double - double with 13 points , nine rebounds , three assists and a block . Bradley Beal , still coming off the bench , poured in 17 points and added three rebounds , an assist and a pair of steals to pace the reserves . The Wizards are currently in fourth place in the Eastern Conference 's Southeast Division , and two games back of the eighth - seeded Chicago Bulls . They remain home to face the Philadelphia 76ers on Monday night .

The Washington Wizards ( 38 - 40 ) defeated the Brooklyn Nets ( 21 - 57 ) 121 - 103 on Wednesday . The Wizards announced earlier in the day that John Wall would miss the game to rest a sore right knee , particularly relevant considering the must - win situation that Washington found itself in to keep their playoff hopes alive . As it turned out , they got by just fine without their All-Star against a Nets squad that was undermanned in its own right . Ramon Sessions stepped in to the starting five and the offense never skipped a beat , as he managed an 18 - point , 13 - assist double - double that also included a trio of rebounds . Despite the victory , the Wizards still depend on other teams for assistance to sneak into the playoffs , but must keep winning regardless to be able to take advantage of any help they might receive .

The dynamic duo of LeBron James and Kevin Love continued their outstanding early - season play Saturday . James posted a 25 - point , 14 - assist double - double , while Kevin Love also accomplished the feat with 20 points and 11 boards .

With the other four members of the first unit combining for just 36 points and the team posting 38 percent and 30 percent success rates from the field and three - point range , respectively , the All-Star guard 's contributions were particularly essential in securing the road victory .

Memphis was expected to win this game rather easily , but Sacramento had some other ideas .

Suns point guard Eric Bledsoe is having by far the most productive season of his career so far , making this cold stretch he has been on over his last four games even more uncharacteristic . His performance Wednesday night was the worst of them all , with Bledsoe shooting just 3 - of - 15 while still managing to come up with 16 points thanks to some good free throw shooting . But this is starting to become a trend , as Bledsoe has shot 13 - of - 47 ( 28 percent ) from the field over his last four contests . Despite those horrific shooting numbers , Bledsoe has still managed to average 16 points per game over that stretch , but that is only because of his ability to get to the line .

The 7 - 22 record the Nets came in to Monday 's game with certainly inspired no confidence that they could topple a Hornets squad sporting a solid 17 - 12 mark , but the one glimmer of hope was the fact that all but one of Brooklyn 's victories had come at home . Accordingly , the hosts put on a spectacular offensive display Monday , even after losing starting point guard Jeremy Lin to a hamstring injury in the third quarter . After a back - and - forth tussle for three quarters , the Nets entered the final period on the wrong end of an 88 - 83 score .

Philadelphia had forged a razor - thin 58 - 57 lead by halftime but had to fight until the closing seconds to pull out the win .

The Brooklyn Nets defeated the Chicago Bulls , 107 - 106 , at Barclays Center on Saturday afternoon .

One of their recent trademarks has been giving quality teams a very difficult time , even those with plenty of motivation for playoff positioning . The Bulls ( 39 - 41 ) were the latest team to learn that lesson the hard way , as they fell victim to a Brooklyn fourth - quarter comeback and dropped a one - point decision that could jeopardize their playoff hopes .

In a game between two Eastern Conference contenders , the Pacers looked like the far superior team in a wire - to - wire win . Indiana got off to a hot start , as they took a 40 - 19 lead early in the second quarter .

Myles Turner continues to shine , as he tallied 16 points , four rebounds , two steals and four blocks in the win , Monta Ellis scored just two points , but provided seven rebounds and eight assists in an efficient night . Paul George was ejected for kicking the ball into the stands and he may face a suspension considering it hit a fan in the face after he scored 13 points in 28 minutes . Dwyane Wade has been surprising spectators with his ability to shoot from long distance this season , but his 1 - of - 9 performance here is one to forget . He actually recorded just one rebound and no assists aside from that , as he looked tired in the second half of a back - to - back set . Indiana still dominated this game , despite scoring just two fastbreak points .
The Boston Celtics defeated the host Indiana Pacers 105 - 99 at Bankers Life Fieldhouse on Saturday .

Avery Bradley also tallied 13 points , eight rebounds and five assists , while Amir Johnson finished with 14 points and nine boards .

Monta Ellis was back in the starting lineup , finishing with 15 points , four rebounds and four assists . The Pacers will look to rebound on Monday , when they host the Orlando Magic for their next game .
With Paul George , Al Horford and Jae Crowder all missing this game , it had to be a team effort from both squads . That was the case too , as no player scored more than 23 points , but 16 players scored at least seven in the 105 - 99 Boston win . Avery Bradley 's 13 points , eight rebounds and five assists continues a rare feat , as Bradley currently leads the Celtics in rebounding out of the shooting guard position . While Isaiah Thomas struggled with his shot ( 4 - of - 13 ) , he made 14 - of - 15 free - throws to finish with 23 points . Kelly Olynyk started for Horford and finished with 16 points , six rebounds and four assists in his best game of the season .

The Atlanta Hawks went on the road and defeated the Indiana Pacers 96 - 85 at Bankers Life Fieldhouse on Wednesday . The Hawks ( 10 - 5 ) were at risk of losing their fourth straight game heading into Wednesday , but Dwight Howard was not going to let that happen . The big man put on a Superman-like performance , notching 23 points and 20 rebounds in 33 minutes . It was his 11th double - double of the season and his first 20 - point , 20 - rebound game . His partner in the frontcourt , Paul Millsap , had a double - double of his own Wednesday night , posting 18 points and 11 rebounds - - his fifth double - double of the season . In the end , the game was won on the boards for Atlanta , as they out - rebounded the Pacers ( 7 - 9 ) by 19 , 56 - 37 . For Indiana , both Paul George and Myles Turner returned to the lineup after missing time with ankle injuries , but even that was n't enough to get past the Hawks . George put together a solid performance , recording 18 points and six rebounds , but shot a poor 6 - of - 22 from the field and 2 - of - 11 from behind the arc . Turner could n't get anything going on the offensive end , posting just seven points on top of nine rebounds in his return . It was Thaddeus Young who ended up leading the way for the Pacers , posting a game - high 24 points on 10 - of - 13 shooting and seven rebounds in 41 minutes . Up next , the Hawks will head to Utah on Friday to take on the Jazz , while the Pacers will stay home Friday to play the Nets .

Following his 23 - points , 20 - rebound performance on Wednesday , he is averaging 15 points and and 13 rebounds per game with 11 double - doubles through 11 games . However , the most telling stat of Howard 's presence in his first season with Atlanta is how much he has improved the team 's overall rebounding , as they currently rank seventh in the NBA in rebounds per game after finishing as the third - worst rebounding team last season . On the other side , the return of Indiana 's star Paul George from an ankle injury did not help their recent offensive woes . After shooting just 32 percent and scoring 83 points against the Warriors on Monday , the team shot 40 percent en route to scoring just 85 points against the Hawks . Between George shooting 6 - of - 22 and starting point guard Jeff Teague shooting 5 - of - 15 from the field , the Pacers did n't have much of a chance to keep up with Atlanta offensively on Wednesday .

In what was a surprising turn , both of Toronto 's All-Star guards struggled , as the two normal top scorers made just 11 shots for 34 points . Lowry had a particularly tough performance , shooting just 1 - of - 9 from beyond the arc . The Raptors as a whole struggled from the field about as much as the Suns succeeded , as the team finished shooting under 40 percent on the night .

The San_Antonio Spurs defeated the Toronto Raptors 108 - 106 Tuesday at AirCanada Centre . The Spurs ( 36 - 9 ) came into Tuesday 's matchup without Pau Gasol ( finger ) , Kawhi Leonard ( hand ) and Tony Parker ( foot ) , but it did n't matter . Even without three regular starters , San_Antonio was able to hold off a struggling Raptors ( 28 - 17 ) team , who remains without their All-Star shooting guard DeMar DeRozan ( ankle ) . In the absence of three stars , LaMarcus Aldridge stepped up with a solid performance , recording a team - high 21 points on 6 - of - 14 shooting from the field to go along with seven rebounds . Patty Mills then added 18 points in 30 critical minutes off the bench .

As for the Raptors , they continue to struggle , as they have now lost four games in a row after winning four in a row just before that . They had a prime opportunity to end that streak against a banged up San_Antonio team , but while Kyle Lowry and the Toronto backcourt managed to take advantage , the frontcourt players struggled to do so . Lowry finished with a game - high 30 points and five rebounds , while Terrance Ross and Norman Powell added 21 and 16 points , respectively . The team 's start frontcourt , however , made up of Jonas Valanciunas , Jared Sullinger and DeMarre Carroll combined to score a grand total of just 11 points . Ball disruption was the ultimate problem , however , as the team managed just 10 assists to their 10 turnovers . Up next , the Spurs will try to make it six straight wins Friday in New Orleans , while the the Raptors will look to end their losing streak when they take on the Grizzlies on Wednesday .
With Tony Parker battling a foot injury , the Spurs decided to look at rookie Dejounte Murray to take over the starting point guard duties in order to leave Patty Mills in his role off the bench . And in his last four starts in Parker 's absence , Murray has already been impressive . Following his performance of 11 points , three rebounds and two assists in Tuesday 's victory over the Raptors , Murray is now averaging 13 points , 3 assists and 3 rebounds per game over his last four starts , which included a career - high 24 points in last Thursday 's victory over the Nuggets . That is more points and rebounds than Parker 's averages this season , and while it is a small sample size , Murray 's production at just 20 years old not only gives the Spurs insurance for this year 's championship run , but for every one in the future as well .

No one player on the Spurs played more than 28 minutes . Next up , the Clippers host the Detroit Pistons on Monday , while the Spurs get some time off before Spurs host the Rockets on Wednesday .
Marreese Speights is proving to be one of the needed bench players to extend the Los_Angeles Clippers depth , one in which they did not have last year after injuries decimated their lineup during the playoffs . Speights added 15 points on 4 - of - 8 shooting in 18 minutes off the bench in Saturday’s win over the San_Antonio Spurs , which will raise the averages he came into the game with through five contests this season . The ex - Warriors player is averaging 10 points and 4 rebounds in 15 minutes per game , and this includes just over one three pointer made per game as well . The efficient shooting will bring his average of 43 percent up and is a bright sign for Los_Angeles going forward . Jamal Crawford picked up his third Sixth Man of the Year award last season with the Clippers , but was used almost as much as the starters in the rotation , and the thin bench did not extend too much past that last year .

Leonard finished with a team - high 39 points on an impressive 12 - of - 18 shooting from the field to go along with six rebounds and five assists in 39 minutes .

The Los_Angeles Lakers defeated the San_Antonio Spurs , 102 - 95 , Wednesday at AT & T Center . On a night where Spurs ( 60 - 18 ) head coach Gregg Popovich decided to rest his key players for the majority of the game , the Lakers ( 23 - 55 ) decided to take advantage , and they wasted no time doing so . After one quarter , Los_Angeles had opened up their lead to 17 points , and that lead eventually grew to as much as 26 in the first half . San_Antonio , even without their star players playing heavy minutes on a back - to - back , managed to trim the lead and get it to a tie early in the fourth quarter .

Somehow , Tony Parker managed to tie for the team - lead in points Wednesday night , as he scored 14 points on 7 - of - 11 shooting in just 16 minutes , with Davis Bertans matching him with 14 points of his own off the bench .

Once again , McCollum successfully shouldered the offensive load for Portland with star Damian Lillard ( ankle ) unable to play . The Blazers shot a horrendous 6 - of - 22 from three - point range , but made up for it with their interior shooting , as the team finished having it over 49 percent of its shots . Center Mason Plumlee had an efficient 18 points on 6 - of - 9 shooting . The Timberwolves , meanwhile , were much less efficient , shooting just 40 percent on the night . Guard Andrew Wiggins led the team with 24 points on 10 - of - 20 shooting , but the rest of the Wolves could not seem to keep up .

The Cleveland Cavaliers defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves 116 - 108 Tuesday at Target Center . The Timberwolves ( 21 - 35 ) managed to keep pace with the East-leading Cavaliers ( 38 - 16 ) for a majority of Tuesday 's contest , and they were well within striking distance down the final stretch of the game . That was until LeBron James hit a step back three - pointer with two minutes remaining to take his team 's lead from three points to six . At that point , Minnesota was finished . James finished with 25 points on an efficient 10 - of - 14 shooting from the field to go along with 14 assists and eight rebounds as the Cavaliers walked out of the Target Center with their second straight victory and their sixth win in their last seven games .

Karl-Anthony Towns had yet another productive night as well , scoring 26 points and grabbing eight rebounds , but besides those two , Minnesota failed to get much else offensively from their team . Ricky Rubio did manage to dish out a game - high 16 assists and grab eight rebounds , but he was n't able to produce enough in the scoring column , ending with just five points on 2 - of - 8 shooting from the field . Up next , the Cavaliers will look to continue to build on their lead in the Eastern Conference on Wednesday against the Pacers , while the Timberwolves will travel to Denver on Wednesday to take on the Nuggets .
This season , Ricky Rubio has proven to be a crucial member of Minnesota 's offense with no legitimate backup point guards and now without the services of Zach LaVine ( knee ) . However , while Rubio has been putting up big - time assist numbers as of late , he remains a liability scoring - wise . Tuesday 's performance was yet another example for the Spaniard , as he posted a game - high 16 assists , which was his highest total since he dished out 17 on Jan. 11 against the Rockets . And while Rubio did an adequate job of getting his teammates involved , he struggled to get himself involved , scoring just five points on 2 - of - 8 shooting from the field . This was n't an aberration for the point guard either , as it was the seventh time this season that Rubio was able to record double - digit assists but not reach double - digit points .
It 's been a rough stretch of three games over the last four days for Kawhi Leonard - - by his standards - - after he got off to a scorching hot start to the month of March . Following his 22 - point performance ( 20 of which came in the second half ) in Tuesday 's comeback victory over the Timberwolves , Leonard has now failed to score at least 25 points in each of his last three games after hitting that total in seven of his eight previous games . The All-Star also has n't been shooting the ball at an efficient rate as of late , with Tuesday 's 54 percent performance from the field being his best since last Wednesday when he hit 57 percent of his shots in a loss to Portland . In the two games in between , Leonard shot a combined 9 - of - 27 ( 30 percent ) from the field , which was easily his worst two - game shooting stretch of the season .
The San_Antonio Spurs defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves 100 - 93 Tuesday at Target Center .

The team was led offensively by LaMarcus Aldridge , who scored a game - high 26 points on 12 - of - 24 shooting from the field . Meanwhile , All-Star swingman Kawhi Leonard had just two points after the first 24 minutes , but he managed to kick it into high gear and score 20 of his 22 points in the second half , which included the go - ahead jumper late in the fourth quarter . The win was the Spurs ' second in a row and they will now return home for a four - game homestand . As for the Timberwolves , the loss was not only their fourth in a row , but after blowing a 12 - point lead , it is the team 's league - leading 18th loss this season after blowing a double - digit lead . They have also now given up at least 100 points in seven straight contests . Offensively , Karl-Anthony Towns led the way with yet another double - double of a team - high 25 points and 14 rebounds , while Andrew Wiggins added 22 points of his own . The two , however , combined to shoot just 13 - of - 32 from the field , and they ended up doing a majority of their work at the free throw line , where the young stars hit 20 of their 23 attempts . Unfortunately for Minnesota , the two did n't get much help , as the only other teammate to score in double figures was Shabazz Muhammad , who scored 18 points in 24 minutes off the bench .

Al Horford 's 14 points per game this season is his lowest scoring average since his second year in the NBA , but the big man affects the game in so many different ways beyond scoring , most of which do n't even show up in the box score . Two of those ways , however , do show up , and they are his rebounds and assists . The Celtics have great rebounding guards and wings that take the pressure off Horford , but when the big man gets on the boards and distributes , Boston has little problem finding success . Horford recorded six rebounds and six assists in Wednesday 's road victory over the Warriors , and when he has recorded those totals this season , the Celtics are 9 - 3 . Even more telling is the fact that in those 12 games , Horford is averaging just 12 points , showing that he is making an big impact , even when the scoring column does n't say so .

Thomas did , however , finish with a team - high 25 points in 34 minutes , but the team 's most valuable performance Wednesday came off the bench from Kelly Olynyk , who scored 17 points on 7 - of - 9 shooting in 26 minutes as a reserve . As for the Warriors , it was a fourth quarter to forget . More specifically , it was a fourth quarter to forget for the reigning two - time MVP Stephen Curry , who was 0 - for - 1 from the field and committed two turnovers in the five minutes he managed to play in the final period . Curry still finished with 23 points on 8 - of - 16 shooting from the field to go along with six assists and five rebounds , while Klay Thompson added a team - high 25 points on 11 - of - 23 shooting .

In fact , it was a wire - to - wire win for the Rockets , as the Cavaliers trailed by at least 20 points for the entirety of the second half . That can be attributed to a 65 - 39 first half in the favor of Houston , as they never got within single - digits after the first quarter either .

The Utah Jazz defeated the Boston Celtics , 107 - 95 , at TD Garden on Friday evening . The Jazz ( 14 - 15 ) came into Friday 's game looking to snap a four - game losing streak , although a road matchup against a tough Celtics ( 24 - 7 ) certainly did n't bode well for their chances of doing so . Matters then took a turn for the worse during the contest , as Rudy Gobert went down in the first quarter after teammate Derrick Favors rolled up on his left knee .

The host Los_Angeles Clippers took down the Utah Jazz , 102 - 84 , at Staples Center on Tuesday . Both the Jazz ( 2 - 2 ) and the Clippers ( 30 ) came into Tuesday 's matchup with hopes of continuing their hot starts to the season . Early on , the game seemed to be a competitive one , with multiple lead changes occurring in the first two quarters . The early going saw strong defensive play on both sides , with lock - down centers Rudy Gobert and DeAndre Jordan each impressing . After the start of the second half , however , Blake Griffin and the Clippers ' offense began to run away with the game . Los_Angeles outscored Utah 33 - 15 in the third quarter , thanks to a quick start from Griffin and the rest of the opening unit . Utah began to mount a comeback effort in the fourth , whittling the lead down to single digits , but quickly saw its hopes stamped out by tough play from the Clippers . Star defensive guard , Patrick Beverley , helped put the game out of reach with two clutch steals in the game 's final minutes , and added a dagger three - pointer on the offensive end . Overall , Los_Angeles once again relied heavily on Griffin as an offensive leader . With superstar point guard Chris Paul parting ways with the Clippers this offseason , the highly - skilled Griffin has seen the ball in his hands more than ever over the first three games . On Tuesday , Griffin helped lead the winning effort with a team - high 22 points , as well as eight rebounds and six assists . Griffin turned heads in the first quarter with an emphatic highlight - reel dunk over All-Defense center Rudy Gobert . Another one of LA 's entertaining dunkers , DeAndre Jordan , also impressed with his play . Jordan led the team with 18 rebounds and chipped in 11 points . However , the game marked an unfortunate return to form for Jordan at the free - throw line , where he shot just 1 - of - 4 after having not missed a free - throw in his first two games of the season . Utah , meanwhile , lost control of the game in the second half but still had plenty of positive takeaways from the loss . Rookie wing Donovan Mitchell had a team - best scoring performance , pouring in 19 points and helping to spark the Jazz 's comeback effort in the fourth quarter . Rudy Gobert , meanwhile , looked potent on both ends of the floor , shooting a perfect 5 - of - 5 from the field and rejecting three shots . It appears Utah has yet to find a consistent go - to scorer to replace Gordon Hayward , however , as in each of the first four games a different member of the Jazz led the team in shot attempts . Mitchell was the team 's top shot - taker on Tuesday with 20 field goal attempts . The Jazz will visit Phoenix on Wednesday , while the Clippers see Portland on Thursday .
The Miami Heat defeated the Los_Angeles Clippers , 104 - 101 , at Staples Center on Sunday afternoon .

Miami forged a 34 - 20 lead by the end of the first quarter and took an 89 - 66 advantage into the fourth period . However , the Clippers ( 5 - 4 ) battled back , ultimately racking up 35 points in the final 12 minutes and even taking a 101 - 100 lead with 26 seconds remaining . A pair of clutch free throws by James Johnson allowed Miami to regain a 102 - 101 advantage with eight seconds left , and Josh Richardson sealed the deal with another pair of successful attempts from the charity stripe after he grabbed a defensive rebound off a missed Blake Griffin 17 - footer . The visitors prevailed despite getting decimated on the glass by a 50 - 37 margin . Hassan Whiteside led the way for the Heat with a 21 - point , 17 - rebound double - double that also included one assist , three steals and two blocks .

The Los_Angeles Clippers took down the Phoenix Suns , 108 - 95 , at Staples Center on Wednesday . The win snapped a three - game losing streak for Los_Angeles ( 12 - 18 ) , but was in line with recent matchups between the two teams . The Clippers have now defeated the Suns in six straight meetings , and have won 15 of their last 17 against Phoenix dating back to 2013 . On Wednesday , the struggling Clippers looked far removed from their recent woes , shooting a healthy 47 percent from the field and holding a double - digit lead for the majority of the game . All-Star center DeAndre Jordan enjoyed a dominant performance on the interior , finishing with 12 points and a game - high 20 rebounds . The game also marked a bounce back for recently - returned Clippers rookie Milos Teodosic . Teodosic , who missed significant time with a foot injury earlier in the season , earned the start and led the team with eight assists in the win . Phoenix ( 11 - 22 ) was coming off two straight wins before dropping to the Clippers on Wednesday . The Suns struggled mightily on the offensive end , shooting just over 36 percent on the night . Those struggles were particularly apparent early in the game , as the team scored just 11 points over the first 10:54 of play . While things began to came together more in the second half , Phoenix was unable to whittle away at the double - digit lead that Los_Angeles established early on . With star shooting guard Devin Booker ( groin ) out , the Suns relied heavily on forward T.J. Warren for scoring . Warren finished the game with 22 points and 10 rebounds , but shot an unimpressive 9 - of - 24 from the field in the game . Rookie wing Josh Jackson also shouldered some of the offensive load , taking 18 shots en route to 17 points . The Clippers will visit Houston to take on the first - place Rockets on Friday . Phoenix , meanwhile , faces the second half of a back - to - back as the Suns host the Grizzlies on Thursday .

The team saw multiple 20 - point outings off the bench , including a team - high 22 from big man Montrezl Harrell . All in all , the Clippers ' second unit scored a whopping 72 points , proving a crucial component of the blowout victory . LA also excelled on the glass , finishing with 22 second - chance points .

The Clippers have now won three of their last four games , despite the continued absence of Blake Griffin ( knee ) . The Kings ( 11 - 22 ) had a two - game road win streak coming into Tuesday 's contest , but looked lost against a red - hot Clippers team . Only one Kings player , Willie Cauley-Stein , scored more than 10 points in the tough loss . Cauley-Stein led the team with 17 .

The Atlanta Hawks defeated the Utah Jazz , 104 - 90 , at Philips Arena on Monday evening .

It 's safe to say the Warriors cruised , though , They built a 12 - point lead at halftime and never looked back , and even though Atlanta won the last two quarters ( 34 - 28 and 25 - 24 , respectively ) , Golden_State was never in danger of losing this game .

However , they were facing a Hawks ( 24 - 58 ) team that was coming off a pair of victories over a couple of other Eastern Conference playoff teams in the Wizards and Celtics . Accordingly , Atlanta came out ready to compete , and they trailed by a very manageable 65 - 61 score at halftime .

A prolific third quarter in which they racked up 37 points left them down by just 83 - 81 heading into the final 12 minutes , but they were never able to quite catch up to their hosts .

Wilson Chandler added 18 points , and Mason Plumlee came out of nowhere to post a strong double - double of 10 points and 13 rebounds .

The Spurs ( 25 - 12 ) had their entire first unit at their disposal Saturday , a development that 's been somewhat of a rarity this season due to injuries and subsequent maintenance programs , especially for Kawhi Leonard . The All-Star forward was not only in action against the Pistons ( 20 - 15 ) , but he ended up logging his highest amount of minutes of the five games he 's played thus far this season . However , his presence was nowhere near enough against a defensive - minded Detroit squad . The home team got off to a hot start with a 24 - 13 lead after one quarter , and they also forged a 30 - 22 advantage over the final 12 minutes to seal the win .

In fact , there were 13 ties and 21 lead changes in total , as the largest lead for either team was an eight - point margin . While Memphis was more efficient from the free - throw line , the difference in the game was Detroit 's ability to get there .

The Pistons ( 29 - 32 ) had an impressive performance at home and put an end to their three - game losing streak with a huge performance at home against a Bucks ( 33 - 28 ) team that never got it going . Things were quite square after the first quarter ( 32 - 32 ) , but Detroit pulled away in the second quarter ( 21 - 12 ) and the Bucks never got it back . In fact , Detroit won the remaining two quarters ( 32 - 26 and 25 - 17 , respectively ) so won quite comfortably in front of their own fans . Andre Drummond was the best player for the Pistons , as he finished with 15 points , 16 rebounds and two steals .

The Oklahoma_City Thunder defeated the New_Orleans Pelicans , 122 - 116 , at Chesapeake Energy Arena on Thursday evening . To say the Pelicans ( 22 - 27 ) faced an uphill battle Thursday would have been one of the bigger understatements of the season . Already down perennial MVP candidate Anthony Davis ( finger ) , New_Orleans was further decimated by the absences of Julius Randle ( ankle ) , Nikola Mirotic ( calf ) and E'Twaun Moore ( rest ) .

Six of those points came from All-Star wing Jimmy Butler , who knocked down consecutive three - pointers . Minnesota was able to grab a nine - point lead , which provided the cushion necessary to stave off a last - minute comeback effort from Los_Angeles . Butler led Minnesota ( 3 - 4 ) with 32 points , which he paired with six rebounds and four assists . Butler delivered at the right time , knocking down four three - pointers in the fourth quarter to help fuel Minnesota 's late push .

The Minnesota Timberwolves defeated the Brooklyn Nets , 120 - 113 , at Target Center on Monday evening .

However , the Nets ( 6 - 8 ) were more than game , forging a 31 - 30 first - quarter lead before the home squad pulled ahead and enjoyed a seven - point halftime advantage . The second half would be just as tightly contested , but the T-Wolves would outscore the Nets by a 63 - 60 margin over the final two periods to seal the win . A gruesome ankle injury suffered by the Nets ' Caris LeVert certainly hurt the visitors ' chances , and the emerging wing had to exit the court in a wheelchair . Shooting also made a key difference , as Minnesota posted a 52 percent success rate , including 44 percent from three - point range . In turn , they limited Brooklyn to 40 percent shooting , which was key to them securing a win despite committing 23 turnovers . D'Angelo Russell paced the Nets with 31 points , a total he supplemented with six assists , two rebounds and two steals .

The Minnesota Timberwolves defeated the Chicago Bulls , 111 - 96 , at Target Center on Saturday night . The Timberwolves ( 9 - 11 ) have plenty of Chicago flavor on their roster and coaching staff , but it 's also true they have significantly more talent than the Bulls ( 5 - 15 ) at present . However , it was the visiting squad that came out strongest Saturday , establishing a 22 - 20 lead after one quarter .

The Minnesota Timberwolves defeated the Sacramento Kings , 112 - 105 , at Target Center on Monday . In their first home game since the All-Star break , the Timberwolves came out very flat . After the first 12 minutes , the Kings led the lethargic Wolves 30 - 19 and looked to be in full control of the game . Then , Karl-Anthony Towns , who had missed the last two games due to a concussion he sustained in a car accident , decided it was time to take over . Towns was the catalyst behind a 20 - 1 run for Minnesota , and the team would end up taking a 10 - point lead into halftime . After trailing by double - digits for majority of the second half , Sacramento did make one final push in the fourth quarter and reduce the deficit to four , but that was as close as the Kings would get . Towns was a force down low in his return to the floor , posting a game - high 34 points , 21 rebounds , five assists and two blocks despite playing just 31 minutes due to foul trouble . Every point was needed from Towns too , as he did n't have much support other than Derrick Rose 's 20 points off the bench and starting point guard Tyus Jones ' 16 points . Minnesota had to do most of its work inside , as nobody except Towns could get it going from deep , with the team going a very poor 8 - of - 31 ( 26 percent ) from behind the arc . As for the Kings , Marvin Bagley continues to impress in his rookie season , as he went head - to - head with Towns on the offensive end . Bagley finished with a team - high 25 points on 9 - of - 14 shooting to go along with 11 rebounds and a pair of blocks . De'Aaron Fox was close behind with 23 points of his own , but it was n't a very efficient night for the point guard , as he shot just 8 - of - 24 from the floor . Buddy Hield and Corey Brewer were the only other Kings players to score in double figures with 18 and 12 points , respectively .

As for the Clippers ( 6 - 5 ) , their loss put an end to a two - game winning streak . The main difference for Los_Angeles in the loss was their inability to close out defensive possessions , as they allowed the Trail_Blazers to get 14 offensive rebounds and they took eight more shots as a result . Lou Williams and Danilo Gallinari led the way for the Clippers on Thursday as each dropped 20 points . It was a rough night shooting the ball for Tobias Harris , who has emerged as the team 's No . 1 option on offense this season , but he still managed to finish with a double - double of 15 points and 11 rebounds in 37 minutes . Rookie Shai Gilgeous-Alexander continues to impress in his first NBA season , scoring 19 points in 35 minutes as the starting point guard .
