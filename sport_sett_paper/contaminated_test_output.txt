The Phoenix Suns ( 8 - 5 ) defeated the Philadelphia 76ers ( 0 - 12 ) 122 - 96 on Friday . Phoenix is in the midst of a six - game road trip . After dropping the first game of the trip 120 - 107 to the Los Angeles Clippers , they 've rattled off three consecutive wins over some of the never - weres of the Eastern Conference . Isaiah Thomas paced the Suns on Friday . He put up 23 points and eight rebounds in 24 minutes off the bench . They 'll continue their trip Saturday in Indiana against the Pacers . Philadelphia has lost 12 straight games to start the season . While that 's a deplorable situation to be in regardless of the situation , it 's in no way a surprise that the Sixers have n't been able to pull off a win . Tony Wroten started at shooting guard next to Michael Carter-Williams on Friday , an experiment the Sixers seemed to be opposed to coming into this season , and it 's a starting lineup that is unlikely to stick . K.J. McDaniels scored a career - high 17 points in 28 minutes , and the fact that he played so many minutes after commenting to the media that he is frustrated with his playing time indicates that the team did n't take much offense to his comments . The Sixers will have a legitmitate chance at their first win of the season Saturday when they go to New York to face the Knicks .
The Philadelphia 76ers ( 16 - 52 ) defeated the Detroit Pistons ( 24 - 44 ) 94 - 83 on Wednesday in Philadelphia . The 76ers were able to pull off the win despite Nerlens Noel leaving the game with a right foot contusion after playing just 22 minutes . He had 11 points on 5 - of - 10 shooting , four rebounds and three blocks in that time and did not return . It was Ish Smith who led the way for Philadelphia , as he was moved into the starting point guard role while Isaiah Canaan was moved to the bench . Smith thrived in the role , recording 15 points on 6 - of - 12 shooting , eight assists and three steals in 26 minutes . Canaan struggled coming off the bench , putting up just nine points on 2 - of - 10 shooting and four assists in 22 minutes . Jason Richardson shot his way out of a slump , scoring 15 points on 4 - of - 7 shooting in 25 minutes , as it was just the first time in five games that Richardson scored in double figures . Conversely , Robert Covington struggled , as he shot just 1 - of - 6 from the field on his way to three points in 22 minutes off the bench . Thomas Robinson and Jerami Grant were able to make positive contributions in their reserve roles , scoring 12 and 10 points respectively . The win is just Philadelphia 's third in 10 games , and they currently boast the third worst record in the NBA . It was a quick fall back to reality for the Pistons , as just a day after upsetting the Grizzlies and ending a 10 - game losing streak , they lost to one of the NBA 's worst teams . They were without Greg Monroe , who sat out his second consecutive game with a strained knee . Despite the loss , Detroit did have some strong performances . Reggie Jackson followed up Tuesday night 's big game with a triple - double , putting up 11 points on just 4 - of - 17 shooting , 11 rebounds and 10 assists in 32 minutes . Kentavious Caldwell-Pope also followed up his 24 - point performance on Tuesday in a strong way , scoring 20 points on 7 - of - 16 shooting and grabbing eight rebounds in 36 minutes . Beyond those two , the Pistons struggled , as no other Detroit player scored in double figures . By losing 11 of their previous 12 games , they are destined for the NBA lottery . Up next , the 76ers will take on the Knicks at home Friday , while the Pistons head home Saturday to take on the Bulls .
The Washington Wizards ( 45 - 33 ) defeated the Philadelphia 76ers ( 18 - 61 ) 119 - 90 on Wednesday in Philadelphia . The Wizards were without All-Star point guard John Wall ( rest ) , but they still no issue dealing with the 76ers .

Bradley Beal led the team in scoring with an efficient 21 points ( 7 - 9 FG , 3 - 3 3Pt , 4 - 5 FT ) in 23 minutes , while Marcin Gortat also put up a nice stat line of 19 points ( 8 - 9 FG ) , seven rebounds and six assists in 26 minutes . Paul Pierce was the only other starter to score in double figures with 10 points in 22 minutes , while Kevin Seraphin ( 12 ) and Will Bynum ( 10 ) each scored in double figures off the bench . Washington shot a very impressive 65 percent from the field and 53 percent from three , and the victory moves them just one game behind both the Bulls and Raptors as they look to make a late push for third place in the Eastern Conference . Robert Covington had a great shooting night and led the way for the 76ers in the losing effort , posting 27 points ( 8 - 11 FG , 4 - 6 3Pt , 7 - 8 FT ) in just 24 minutes and was the only Philadelphia starter to reach double figures on the night . Jason Richardson also had an efficient performance , scoring 17 points ( 6 - 7 FG , 4 - 5 3Pt ) in 21 minutes off the bench . Thomas Robinson scored 11 points and was the only other 76er to score in double figures , but he also added 12 rebounds to give himself a double - double on the night .

The Bucks continued to gain some steam as the regular season winds down , notching their third straight victory and finishing the season sweep over the Sixers . They 've already locked up the sixth seed in the Eastern Conference standings , so this was another solid momentum builder for the playoffs that start this coming Saturday . The game did get somewhat chippy towards the end though , as both Jerryd Bayless and O.J. Mayo received technical fouls for the Bucks , while Jakaar Sampson picked one up for the Sixers . The Bucks were the superior shooters in this game , going 49 percent from the field and 44 percent from the three - point line , while the Sixers finished at 40 percent from the floor and just 21 percent from deep . Michael Carter-Williams had another strong showing , finishing with 30 points ( 11 - 17 FG , 8 - 13 FT ) , five rebounds , five assists and three steals . Over his last four games , he 's averaged 23 points , six assists and 3 steals , so the Bucks would love to see him stay this hot going into their playoff series with either the Toronto Raptors or Chicago Bulls . Giannis Antetokounmpo had a solid overall game as well , recording 12 points ( 3 - 9 FG , 6 - 10 FT ) , seven rebounds and three assists over 34 minutes .

The Sixers were led by the duo of Robert Covington and Hollis Thompson . Covington went 6 - for - 13 from the field , but just 1 - for - 6 from the three - point line to score a team - high of 25 points , while also adding seven rebounds and four blocked shots . It was n't all good for the forward though , as he turned the ball over a whopping 10 times . He 's played well over these final games other than the turnovers , averaging 24 points over his last three . Thompson , on the other hand , finished with 19 points ( 7 - 18 FG , 3 - 10 3Pt , 2 - 2 FT ) and four rebounds over 36 minutes . Thompson shot less than 40 percent from the field in three of his last four games coming into this one , so it was a step in the right direction Monday with his performance . Thomas Robinson and Jakaar Sampson finished in double figures off the bench . Robinson posted 12 points ( 4 - 8 FG , 4 - 6 FT ) and six rebounds , while Sampson had 10 points ( 3 - 8 FG , 0 - 4 3Pt , 4 - 4 FT ) and five rebounds . The Bucks ' regular season will come to an end at home against the Boston Celtics on Wednesday , while the Sixers will be at home against the Miami Heat on Wednesday .
The Milwaukee Bucks ( 8 - 7 ) defeated the Detroit Pistons ( 3 - 11 ) 98 - 86 on Tuesday at the BMO Harris Bradley Center in Milwaukee .

The Bucks were able to out - score the Pistons 30 - 19 in the third quarter , setting themselves up for the victory . They also out - rebounded the Pistons 50 - 36 , giving them even more of an advantage . The Bucks were led by Brandon Knight , who despite being questionable to play with a quad injury , took the court and recorded 20 points ( 7 - 12 FG , 3 - 5 3Pt , 3 - 4 FT ) and eight assists . He 's now combined for 47 points in the last two games , as he has found his shooting stroke as of late . O.J. Mayo was in the starting lineup at shooting guard for the first time this season . He capitalized on his opportunity as he shot 5 - for - 10 from the field and 3 - for - 4 from the three - point line to score 17 points . He 's averaging only 11 points on the year , so the promotion into the starting lineup may have provided him some extra motivation . Larry Sanders and Jabari Parker both played well in the victory and were big reasons for the rebound advantage . Sanders had 12 points and nine rebounds , while Parker had 14 points and nine rebounds . The Bucks have been a surprise this season and will look to continue with their momentum . Despite the loss , the Pistons were led by a double - double from center Andre Drummond who scored 23 points and grabbed 10 rebounds in 32 minutes . He has now recorded 10 or more rebounds in an impressive 11 of 14 games this season .

Augustin was the starter at point guard . He shot 4 - for - 11 from the field and 1 - for - 1 from the three - point line to score 11 points , while handing out seven assists .

No bucket was bigger than his fadeaway game - winner though . Ellis has been on fire lately , but he got plenty of help on Wednesday , as six players scored in double figures . Tyson Chandler scored 18 points ( 8 - 11 FG , 2 - 6 FT ) to go with 20 rebounds . To make the win even more impressive , the Mavs decided to rest Dirk Nowitzki on Wednesday .

The Charlotte Hornets ( 10 - 19 ) defeated the Milwaukee Bucks ( 14 - 15 ) 108 - 101 on Tuesday . Charlotte has won four straight games , and while the wins have come during an easy part of their schedule ( Sixers , Jazz , Nuggets , Bucks ) , the talking heads have tried to fit the narrative of Lance Stephenson ( groin ) sitting out as the reason for the Hornets ' success . Stephenson has missed the last four games , coinciding with the Hornets ' resurgence , and while they have no doubt played remarkably better of late , putting all the blame on one player is misleading . Kemba Walker led with the way Tuesday , putting up a team - high 27 points in 36 minutes . Charlotte will go on the road to face the Oklahoma City Thunder on Friday . Milwaukee has dropped two straight and three of their last four games as they struggle to try and fill the hole of Jabari Parker ( knee ) being out for the rest of the season .

While both teams finished at 43 percent from the field , the Pacers were better from the three - point line , as they shot 40 percent from deep , while the Bucks shot just 29 percent . Roy Hibbert was a force in this one , as the Bucks did n't have much of an answer for him . Hibbert went 6 - for - 11 from the field and a perfect 6 - for - 6 from the free throw line to score 18 points , while also adding seven rebounds . Hibbert is only averaging 11 points so far this season , so it was good to see him heat up a little bit against a mostly inexperienced Bucks front line . The Pacers did receive a couple of big contributions off the bench . Leading all scorers , C.J. Miles went 8 - for - 14 from the field and 6 - for - 9 from the three - point line to score 22 points in 32 minutes . He 's now combined for 47 points over the last two games , as he 's taken it upon himself to give the Pacers another proven scorer . Luis Scola also had an efficient game off the bench . He had 14 points ( 7 - 9 FG , 0 - 2 FT ) and five rebounds in only 17 minutes . The only other Pacer to reach double figures in points was Rodney Stuckey , who had 11 points . The Bucks were led by Brandon Knight , as he went 9 - for - 19 from the field and 2 - for - 5 from the three - point line to score 20 points , while also adding seven assists and four steals . Knight continues to be one of the more reliable offensive threats for the Bucks and has now combined for 46 points over his last two outings . He 's averaging 18 points and 5 assists on the year . Zaza Puchilia did everything he could to combat Hibbert . Pachulia finished with a double - double , posting 12 points and 14 rebounds . It was only his third double - double of the year . Also with a double - double , John Henson came off the bench for 14 points and 10 rebounds . Henson was very efficient as he did this in only 23 minutes . It was arguably his best game of the year considering he set season - highs in both points and rebounds . The Pacers ' next game will be on the road against the Los Angeles Lakers on Sunday , while the Bucks will travel to New York to play the Knicks on Sunday .

The Cavaliers are now riding a four - game win streak and have clinched the second seed in the Eastern Conference playoffs . The Bucks , on the other hand , are currently the sixth projected playoff seed in the East .

The Raptors took the game down to the wire , with Jonas Valanciunas ( 18 points , 15 rebounds ) and Kyle Lowry ( 16 points , 14 assists ) both putting up double - doubles , but their quality performances were n't enough to put the Raptors over the top .

It is unclear how long Westbrook will be out with the injury , but some reports suggested he could miss a few as two weeks . With Kevin Durant already sidelined due to foot surgery for at least the first month of the season , the Thunder are in danger of digging a hole to start their season that may be too deep to crawl out of and reach the playoffs in the Western Conference . In addition to Durant , the Thunder are also dealing with injuries to Anthony Morrow , Mitch McGary , Jeremy Lamb , Grant Jerrett , and Reggie Jackson . They may only have eight healthy players for their next game if no one returns to action Saturday against the Denver Nuggets . The Clippers could n't create much separation from Oklahoma_City despite all of the injuries the Thunder are dealing with . Spencer Hawes was brought in this offseason to help shore up the Clippers ' frontcourt depth by giving them a versatile shooter off the bench . It was expected Hawes might carve out a big enough role to steal some minutes from starters Blake Griffin and DeAndre Jordan , but that was n't the case in the opener as Hawes played just 19 minutes off the bench , while Griffin played 38 and Jordan played 35 . The Clippers finish off a back - to - back set to start the season on Friday when they play Lakers .

Also scoring less than his season scoring average was Chandler Parsons , who recorded just 11 points ( 5 - 11 FG , 1 - 5 3Pt , 0 - 1 FT ) and six rebounds . Like Nowitzki , he 's been playing poorly offensively of late and is averaging just 10 points over his last four games .

Rookie Jordan Clarkson had a solid game in the losing effort , finishing with 15 points ( 6 - 13 FG , 0 - 1 3Pt , 3 - 4 FT ) , six rebounds and five assists . It was his second strong showing in a row , as he 's coming off a 25 - point , six - assist performance Friday . Over those two games , he 's shot a combined 18 - for - 31 from the field , as he looks to be dialed in and more confident than he 's been all season long .

The Dallas Mavericks ( 49 - 31 ) defeated the Los_Angeles Lakers ( 21 - 59 ) 120 - 106 on Sunday at the Staples Center in Los_Angeles . It was another nice victory for the Mavericks , who have now extended their winning streak to three straight games . They 're already locked in as the seventh seed in the Western Conference standings , so they 'll look to continue to build their momentum with the playoffs on the verge of beginning . The Lakers have been eliminated from the playoffs for quite some time now , but the loss only helps their cause , as a worse record increases the potential for a higher landing spot for the 2015 NBA Draft . With the fourth worst record in the league , it 's almost a sure thing they 'll get a very high pick come draft day . The Mavericks were the superior shooters in this game , going 54 percent from the field and 48 percent from the three - point line , while the Lakers finished at 44 percent from the floor and 38 percent from deep . It was Tyson Chandler who surprisingly led the team in scoring . He went 9 - for - 10 from the field and 2 - for - 4 from the free throw line to score a team - high of 20 points , while also adding nine rebounds and two blocked shots . The Lakers were just too young and inexperienced in their frontcourt , as Chandler was able to have a field day . It was just the fourth time all season that he reached the 20 - point mark , so it was easily one of his best offensive performances of the year . Richard Jefferson also gave a solid contribution . In 27 minutes as a starter , he finished with 17 points ( 4 - 7 FG , 2 - 4 3Pt , 7 - 9 FT ) and three rebounds . He 's shot very well over his last two games and has combined for 41 points during that span , so he 'll look to keep his confidence high going into the playoffs . Dirk Nowitzki was the third starter in double figures , as he recorded 16 points ( 5 - 10 FG , 2 - 4 3Pt , 4 - 4 FT ) and four rebounds . He 's now averaging 19 points over his last seven games . Coming off the bench , Charlie Villanueva added 14 points ( 5 - 11 FG , 3 - 6 3Pt , 1 - 2 FT ) and four rebounds , while Raymond Felton chipped in with 15 points ( 7 - 10 FG , 1 - 2 3Pt ) and three assists . The Lakers production was very spread out through their lineup Sunday , with seven players reaching double - digit points . Jordan Clarkson led the way , finishing with a game - high of 26 points ( 9 - 19 FG , 3 - 6 3Pt , 5 - 5 FT ) , to go along with six assists and two steals . The rookie has been a very nice surprise for the Lakers so far this season , as he 's averaged 21 points and 8 assists over his last four games . Clarkson received some help from Wesley Johnson though . Johnson went 6 - for - 9 from the field and 4 - for - 5 from the three - point line to score an efficient 16 points over 20 minutes . He had shot below 40 percent from the field in four out of his last five games coming into Sunday , so it was good to see him finally have some better success in this one . While it was n't his best game shooting the ball , Jabari Brown still posted 18 points ( 4 - 13 FG , 2 - 6 3Pt , 8 - 9 FT ) and two assists over 42 minutes . He 's combined for 38 points and nine assists over his last two games , moving his season averages to 10 points and 2 assists over 17 games with the Lakers . The Lakers ' next game will be on the road against the Sacramento Kings on Monday , while the Kings will travel to Utah to play the Jazz on Monday .

The Wizards slowly chipped away at the Boston lead , and a John Wall-led run late in the period brought the Wizards to within one with 32 seconds to play . A Rasual Butler free throw with 16 seconds to play tied the game , and Victor Oladipo misfired on a long jumper on the other end , giving the Wizards a chance to win with 1 seconds remaining . That’s all Beal would need , as he caught a perfect inbound lob from Andre Miller and laid it in as time expired .

It was his twelfth double - double in a row , pushing his season averages to 18 points and 12 rebounds per game . While slightly over - shadowed by the performances of Butler and Gasol , Joakim Noah had a large impact on this game . He finished with 18 points ( 7 - 10 FG , 4 - 4 FT ) , nine rebounds and two steals .

The ever so consistent Nikola Vucevic had somewhat of a down game , totaling 14 points ( 5 - 14 FG , 4 - 5 FT ) and seven rebounds in 32 minutes . It was his lowest scoring output since January ninth against the Lakers , so it came quite unexpected . Coming off the bench , Evan Fournier was very efficient with his time and posted 14 points ( 5 - 7 FG , 1 - 3 3Pt , 3 - 4 FT ) , three rebounds and three assists in only 18 minutes . The Magic 's next game will be on the road against the Washington Wizards on Monday , while the Bulls will be at home against the Sacramento Kings on Tuesday .

The Indiana Pacers ( 29 - 34 ) defeated the Orlando Magic ( 21 - 44 ) 118 - 86 on Tuesday at Bankers Life Fieldhouse in Indianapolis .

That effort was led by Rodney Stuckey , who went 13 - for - 19 from the field and 6 - for - 9 from the three - point line to score a game - high of 34 points , while also adding six rebounds and seven assists . It was a new season - high in points for the guard , who 's now averaging 19 points and 4 assists over his last six games .

He 's picked his game up of late , and is averaging 21 points and 5 rebounds over his last three games .

Over that three - game stretch , he 's averaging 14 points , 6 rebounds and 8 assists , as he 's done a little bit of everything for the Magic during that span .

Los_Angeles has won their last two games , defeating the Toronto Raptors 129 - 122 in overtime Sunday before going on the road to beat the Pistons . Kobe Bryant had a dubious triple - double to encore the 31 - point , 11 - rebound and 12 - assist line he put up Sunday . Bryant finished with 12 points , 13 assists and 10 turnovers Tuesday . His barrage of assists have been accompanied by wins for the Lakers , but Bryant has put on passing clinics in small stretches before that faded quickly in the past , indicating that he will likely regress back to being more of a scoring threat than a facilitator most nights . The Lakers have two more games on their road trip , and they 'll finish a back - to - back set Wednesday when they go to Washington to take on the Wizards . Detroit has dropped nine straight games . Over their last two contests , they 've used Greg Monroe off the bench and shifted Josh Smith to power forward so they could add an extra shooter on the wing . Kyle Singler has started at small forward both gmes , but after he played just 17 minutes Tuesday , it appears his hold on the job may not be too tight . While defense is n't the Lakers ' forte , they were successful in limiting the Pistons to 37 percent shooting from the field and 29 percent from beyond the arc . Detroit is playing a back - to - back set , and they 'll travel to Boston to take on the Celtics on Wednesday .
The Portland Trail_Blazers ( 17 - 4 ) defeated the Detroit Pistons ( 3 - 19 ) 98 - 86 on Tuesday . Portland is on a five - game win streak . LaMarcus Aldridge took home the game - high scoring honors for a second straight game , finishing with 23 points . The Blazers shot 49 percent from the field , compared to the Pistons ' 35 percent from the field , which tells the gross part of the story as to how they came away with the win . They did n't sell the Pistons any buckets . Detroit has lost 13 straight games in what has been a nightmarish start to the season . Coach Stan Van Gundy has tried to be patient with his rotations and starting lineup , but the players have n't rewarded him with much in the win column . Greg Monroe 's 22 - point , 10 - rebound double - double in 33 minutes off the bench was the only bright spot from the Pistons . They could have Jodie Meeks ( back ) make his season debut in Friday 's game , and it 'll be interesting to see if a single role player can help them dig out of the hole they 've dug .
The Detroit Pistons ( 10 - 23 ) defeated the Sacramento Kings ( 14 - 20 ) 114 - 95 on Sunday at the Palace of Auburn Hills .

The only other Piston to reach double figures in points was Jodie Meeks , who came off the bench for 13 points ( 5 - 12 FG , 1 - 3 3Pt , 2 - 2 FT ) . The Kings on the other hand continued to be led by superstar DeMarcus Cousins , who finished with a team - high of 18 points ( 5 - 17 FG , 0 - 1 3Pt , 8 - 11 FT ) and 15 rebounds . It marked his fourth double - double over the last five games , and pushes his season averages to 24 points and 12 rebounds per game . Cousins was n't the only one to find success despite the loss . Darren Collison went 5 - for - 7 from the field and 2 - for - 2 from the three - point line to score 17 points , while also adding six rebounds and three steals .

The Minnesota Timberwolves ( 11 - 40 ) defeated the Detroit Pistons ( 20 - 32 ) 112 - 101 on Sunday at the Palace of Auburn Hills . A good portion of this victory can be placed on the Timberwolves ' fast start , as they out - scored the Pistons 61 - 51 in the first half . The Timberwolves also used their superior shooting , considering they went 51 percent from the field and 42 percent from the three - point line , while the Pistons finished at 47 percent from the floor and just 32 percent from beyond the arc .

Andre Drummond nearly notched a double - double of his own , but came up just shy with 14 points ( 7 - 11 FG , 0 - 1 FT ) and eight rebounds .

They were able to out - shoot the Rockets , as they went 46 percent from the field compared to the 42 percent of Houston , but with James Harden taking control in the final quarter , the Knicks were n't able to find an answer to steal a victory from the Rockets on the road .

In the past three games , Harden has now scored 92 points , as he continues to make his case for this season 's MVP award . Harden did receive a little help though .

Trevor Ariza was the only other Rocket to reach double figures in points as he finished with 10 . He seemed to struggle with his shot though , as he went only 3 - for - 10 from the field and 2 - for - 6 from the three - point line . Despite having three starters out with injury , the Rockets still secured the victory . The Knicks really struggled to find any offense with Anthony leaving during the second quarter .

Len did his damage off the bench , while starting center Miles Plumlee played just 15 minutes , a development that does n't mean much in the course of one game , but after the Suns invested a fifth - overall pick in the 2013 NBA Draft on Len , his development is something they 're going to be keen to push , and that may come at the expense of Plumlee at some point . Isaiah Thomas lead the Suns with a team - high 23 points off the bench . The Spurs have four days off before their next game at home Wednesday against the Atlanta Hawks . The Suns will finish a back - to - back set on the road Saturday against the Utah Jazz .

He 's now averaging 15 points and 6 rebounds on the year . Also getting a piece of the action was Eric Bledsoe , who had a great night shooting the ball to finish with 18 points ( 7 - 14 FG , 2 - 5 3Pt , 2 - 2 FT ) and nine assists . It was his second strong showing in a row , as he 's combined for 37 points and 12 assists over his last two games .

Warren had a breakout performance and scored 17 points ( 8 - 10 FG , 0 - 1 3Pt , 1 - 2 FT ) in just 19 minutes .

In a solid performance off the bench , Justin Hamilton went 7 - for - 12 from the field and 1 - for - 4 from the three - point line to score a season - high of 15 points , while also adding three rebounds and two blocked shots .

In 29 minutes , he finished with 10 points ( 3 - 9 FG , 4 - 4 FT ) and three rebounds .

Wall knocked down 1 - of - 2 free throws after being intentionally fouled , leaving the Pacers with a chance to win or tie with 12 ticks on the clock .

The Houston Rockets ( 50 - 23 ) defeated the Washington Wizards ( 41 - 32 ) , 99 - 91 , on Sunday at the Verizon Center . Sunday 's earliest game got off to a sluggish start , especially for the Wizards . For much of the game , Washington 's John Wall appeared to be the only Wizard that was playing at full speed . Houston started to let its lead slip away during the fourth quarter when Washington 's Otto Porter canned a three to cut it to four . The Rockets answered with consecutive three pointers to extend the lead back to double digits . Every time the Wizards would start to embark on a comeback , the Rockets had an answer . The `` Hack a Howard '' strategy backfired for the Wizards as Dwight Howard hit five of his eight free throw attempts . Bradley Beal had a chance to cut Houston 's lead to three late in the game , but had his shot rejected by James Harden , which all but sealed it for Houston . Houston has now won four in a row , three of which have come on the road . The Rockets are the third - best road team in the league , behind only the Hawks and Warriors with a 23 - 13 mark away from the Toyota Center . Sunday 's win temporarily puts Houston in a tie with Memphis for the second sweed in the West .

The Philadelphia 76ers ( 0 - 2 ) were blown out of the building in their home opener Friday against the Utah Jazz ( 1 - 1 ) , losing 99 - 71 . The Jazz jumped out to a 28 - 19 advantage after the first quarter and kept pouring it on throughout the contest , leading 50 - 33 at the break and outscoring the 76ers in the final two quarters as well . Though Utah shot just 41 percent from the field , they ran away with the game by winning the turnover battle by a huge margin , surrendering the ball just seven times to the Sixers’ 18 giveaways . Rodney Hood and Alec Burks led the backcourt with 17 and 15 points , respectively , while Derrick Favors secured a double - double with 20 points and 12 boards to accompany three steals and two blocks . The 76ers compounded their turnover problems by shooting even worse than Utah from the field , submitting a 30 percent mark as a team . The chief offender was star center Nerlens Noel , who accrued just eight points while going 2 - for - 12 from the field . Philadelphia’s immense struggles earned a chorus of boos from the home crowd at multiple points in the game , a development unsurprising given the lack of progress the team has made since embarking on its massive rebuilding effort a couple years ago . Up next for Utah is a date with the Indiana Pacers in the second game of a road back - to - back set . The Sixers will attempt to pick up their first win of the season Monday against the Cleveland Cavaliers .
The Sacramento Kings ( 22 - 31 ) earned a road win Wednesday at Wells Fargo Center over the Philadelphia 76ers ( 8 - 45 ) , 114 - 110 . The 76ers led for the vast majority of the game and stretched their lead to as much as 16 early in the third quarter . But the Kings managed to hang around enough to let their starters make a run late in the fourth quarter . Trailing by six with 3:44 to go , Rajon Rondo made a layup that sparked an 11 - 2 run to give the Kings a lead they would n't relinquish . DeMarcus Cousins led the Kings with 28 points ( 8 - 18 FG , 12 - 17 FT ) and 12 rebounds for his third double - double in the past five games . Darren Collison had a huge game off the bench , as he poured in 25 points ( 9 - 12 FG , 2 - 2 3PT , 5 - 6 FT ) and turned the ball over just once in 32 minutes . Rudy Gay scored 22 and Rajon Rondo added 14 points with a game - high 15 assists as the Kings managed to win despite shooting just 4 - 16 ( 25 percent ) from three . Robert Covington drained seven of his 11 three - point attempts en route to a game - high 29 points , just part of a three - point barrage from the 76ers , who shot 15 - 34 ( 44 percent ) from deep . Jahlil Okafor scored 26 points working inside ( 11 - 18 FG , 4 - 5 FT ) and added 10 rebounds , five assists and two blocks , and Nik Stauskas scored 16 behind a 4 - 5 effort from three . But the 76ers turned it over 19 times and allowed 26 points off those turnovers , dooming them despite their hot shooting . The Kings return home next Friday for a matchup with the Nuggets . The 76ers will take to the road to face the Pelicans next Friday .
The Philadelphia 76ers ( 9 - 56 ) came one step closer to reaching double - digit wins for the season on Friday night , beating the Eastern Conference 's 14th - ranked team , the Brooklyn Nets ( 18 - 47 ) , 95 - 89 . The Sixers learned this afternoon that standout rookie Jahlil Okafor will likely miss the remainder of the season due to a torn right meniscus . This was a crushing blow for the already struggling team , as Okafor had been the team 's leading scorer up until this point . His absence did not seem to present too much of an issue , however , as it gave sophomore big man Nerlens Noel the chance to take the reigns . Noel stuffed the stat sheet for 13 points , 11 rebounds , three blocks , and two steals . Point guard Ish Smith also impressed , approaching a triple - double with 10 points , seven rebounds , and nine assists . The Nets continued to rely heavily on stars Brook Lopez and Thaddeus Young , who scored 24 and 21 points respectively . Young also pulled down nine rebounds and Lopez had three blocks in what was a solid showing for the powerhouse frontcourt . The rest of the team , however , has suffered largely from injuries and lack of veteran experience throughout the season , and it showed on Friday . The Brooklyn bench went a combined 5 - for - 20 from the field with multiple players scoring no points in over 10 minutes played . The team as a whole shot just 38 percent from the floor , as they could not seem to find the basket whatsoever . Philadelphia will take on Detroit on Sunday for the second half of a back - to - back . The Nets , meanwhile , will see Milwaukee on Monday .
The Knicks dominated the Bucks en route to a 122 - 97 win in Wednesday night 's season opener in Milwaukee . All eyes were on fourth overall pick Kristaps Porzingus , who did not disappoint in his NBA regular season debut for the Knicks , scoring 16 points and adding five rebounds . But the most surprising performance for New_York came from Derrick Williams . A lottery pick back in 2011 , Williams exploded for 24 points on 8 - of - 17 shooting and ripped down seven rebounds in just 21 minutes . The performances of Porzingus and Williams overshadowed the return of Carmelo Anthony . After undergoing knee surgery in February , Anthony missed much of the 2014 - 15 season . He had plenty of time to rehab this offseason , but came out flat in the opener with a minuscule 11 points ( 4 - 16 FG , 1 - 5 3Pt , 2 - 2 FT ) , six rebounds and five assists in 29 minutes . The Knicks bench ended up outscoring the starters 73 - 49 . Milwaukee was missing three key players Wednesday ; Jabari Parker ( knee ) , Giannis Antetokounmpo ( suspension ) , and O.J.

The Toronto Raptors ( 45 - 21 ) took care of the Milwaukee Bucks ( 29 - 39 ) in a 107 - 89 victory on Tuesday . This appeared to be a lopsided matchup on paper and the Raptors took it to the Bucks . It was the second and third quarters that made a difference , as Toronto outscored Milwaukee 59 to 38 in that stretch . The rebounding was a huge difference , with the Raptors bringing down 48 rebounds to the Bucks 37 . The three - point shooting was a factor as well , with Milwaukee shooting 15 percent , while Toronto shot over 48 percent .

The Utah Jazz ( 34 - 36 ) dispatched the Milwaukee Bucks ( 30 - 40 ) Sunday at BMO Harris Bradley Center , 94 - 85 . Utah held just a 43 - 42 lead after a tight first half , but the Jazz ended the quarter on a 26 - 8 run to carry a 14 - point lead into the fourth quarter . The Bucks went without a field goal for a 6:58 stretch in the period as their offense just could n't get revved up . Utah never trailed in the game 's final period as they coasted to the victory . Gordon Hayward scored 18 points and hit three three - pointers to lead the Jazz . The Jazz also got double - doubles from Rudy Gobert with points 12 ( 4 - 7 FG , 4 - 4 FT ) and 14 rebounds ( six offensive ) and Shelvin Mack with 13 points ( 5 - 11 FG ) and 12 assists .

With President Barack Obama in town Tuesday to check in on his hometown team , the Bulls were able to come away with a victory on their home court , defeating the Cavaliers by a 97 - 95 count . The Cavaliers remained competitive through the fourth quarter thanks largely to the efforts of LeBron James , who poured in 25 points , 10 rebounds , five steals over 36 minutes . The same couldn’t be said of James’ co - star , Kevin Love , who was playing in his first meaningful game since dislocating his elbow in the first round of last season’s playoffs . Love would end up with 18 points thanks to a hot fourth quarter , but shot a woeful 6 - for - 17 from the field . Even with Love back in the fold , the Cavaliers were still playing at less than full strength with backcourt starters Kyrie Irving ( knee ) and Iman Shumpert ( wrist ) out for extended action . While their replacements in the lineup , Mo Williams ( 19 points , seven assists ) and J.R. Smith ( eight points , five boards , three assists ) had their moments , they couldn’t keep up with an effective Bulls attack . Despite entering the game with some uncertainty regarding how much playing time he’d receive while he continued to experience blurred vision , Derrick Rose turned in a strong outing for the Bulls , contributing 18 points and five assists in 32 minutes . Along with Rose , second - year man Nikola Mirotic drove the Chicago attack , piling up 19 points and nine rebounds . Meanwhile , the man Mirotic replaced in the starting lineup , Joakim Noah , failed to record any points in 17 minutes , before limping off the court in the second half after taking a hard hit to the ankle . The Bulls didn’t provide an update on his condition before the game ended . After holding off the Cavs , the Bulls will look to push their record to 20 when they head to Brooklyn for a game Wednesday . Cleveland will also finish off a back - to - back set Wednesday with a date in Memphis .
The Chicago Bulls ( 18 - 12 ) defeated the Indiana Pacers ( 18 - 13 ) 102 - 100 in overtime on Wednesday . The game was a tale of two halves , with Chicago building a 50 - 40 lead by intermission , largely on the strength of a second period in which they outscored the visitors 29 - 19 . However , Indiana came out of the locker room ready to play catch - up in the third period , and clawed all the way back to take a 91 - 89 lead on a Monta Ellis layup with 31 seconds remaining in regulation . Jimmy Butler then made a clutch driving layup for the Bulls at the 25 - second mark to knot things up at 91 . Following Ellis ' missed 30 - foot three - point attempt with one second remaining , the contest went into the extra period . `` Jimmy Buckets '' was the hero again for the home team in the `` fifth quarter '' by notching four points , including a game - winning tip - in with 1 seconds remaining to seal the hard - fought victory .

He notably visited the free - throw line 13 times , draining 11 of those attempts successfully . Pau Gasol had a relatively subdued but efficient double - double with 13 points and 11 rebounds . He also added three blocks and a sole assist , which came on Butler 's game - winning shot . While no other starter was able to get into double - digits scoring - wise , two very productive performances off the bench were crucial to Chicago 's cause . With Derrick Rose sitting with a sore hamstring , Aaron Brooks showed he had the hot hand early despite yielding the start to Kirk Hinrich , and ended up playing a robust 41 minutes . Brooks tallied a season - high 29 points , and was successful on four of his seven three - point tries . While he did turn the ball over six times , he provided some badly - needed scoring punch in Rose 's stead . 2015 first - round pick Bobby Portis also pitched in significantly off the bench with 16 points , seven rebounds , a steal and a block . The Bulls improved to 18 - 12 and are now in second place in the Eastern Conference 's Central Division.They remain home for a New Year 's Day matchup against the Knicks .

The Bulls will play a second straight home game Thursday against the Celtics , while the Bucks are off until Friday 's home tilt with the Mavericks .
The Chicago Bulls ( 22 - 12 ) took care of business on their home court Thursday night , as they defeated the Boston Celtics ( 19 - 17 ) at United Center , 101 - 92 Trailing 43 - 33 with 3:58 to go in the second quarter , the Bulls kicked it into high gear to end the half , closing the quarter with a 15 - 4 run to take a 48 - 47 halftime lead .

The Miami Heat ( 24 - 21 ) picked up an Eastern Conference road win over the Chicago Bulls ( 25 - 19 ) on Wednesday night at United Center , 89 - 84 .

The two clubs combined to shoot a brutal 8 - 32 ( 25 percent ) from beyond the three - point line , and both teams finished under 30 percent from downtown . The Heat mustered just 12 points in the third quarter , but on a sluggish offensive night all - around , it was enough to keep them in the game .

The star also notched pairs of blocks and steals on the defensive end , ultimately dominating the low post enough to push Chicago over the top on Saturday . 36 points from James Harden did n't make a difference on Saturday , as the Rockets fell to the faltering Bulls .

The Cavaliers came into the contest tied with the Heat as the stingiest Eastern Conference team in terms of points allowed , yielding only 95 per game . They further cemented their reputation with a suffocation of the Magic 's offense , preventing their starting five from producing a single double - digit scorer .

This was an important statement game for the Cavs on their home floor against the high - octane Celtics , who came in winners of their previous five .

The Cleveland Cavaliers ( 48 - 19 ) defeated the Dallas Mavericks ( 34 - 34 ) 99 - 98 on Wednesday . As part of a plan to keep starters fresh for the playoffs , LeBron James was given the night off by coach Tyronn Lue , placing a greater degree of responsibility on fellow superstar Kyrie Irving . The All-Star guard , as he often did prior to James ' return at the start of last season , largely placed the offense on his shoulders , but it was a key defensive play on his part that helped seal the victory . Irving totaled a game - high 33 points , and added five rebounds , an assist , a block and a steal with 3 seconds left on a pass intended for Dirk Nowitzki . He was fouled right after swiping the ball , and sunk two decisive free throws to provide just enough cushion to withstand Deron Williams ' three - pointer at the buzzer and still allow Cleveland to walk away victorious . Kevin Love pitched in with a strong effort of his own to support Iriving , tallying 23 points , 18 rebounds , an assist and a pair of blocks . J.R. Smith was next with 13 points , four rebounds , four assists and three steals . Channing Frye continued his strong play off the bench , pacing the reserves with 14 points , three rebounds and a steal . Tristan Thompson , drawing the start at center , notably went scoreless over 37 minutes but did haul in eight rebounds and dish out two assists . The Cavs continue atop both the Eastern Conference 's Central Division , and the conference as a whole . They head to Orlando to take on the Magic on Friday . The Mavs were led by a pair of 20 - point efforts from two of their big men . Nowitzki paced the starters that point total , and added four rebounds , three assists and three blocks . David Lee led the reserves his tally , and supplemented the scoring with three rebounds and an assist . J.J. Barea was the only other Dallas player - - starter or reserve - - to manage double - digit scoring , supplying 17 points , four assists and three rebounds in 23 minutes off the bench . The Mavs are currently in fourth place in the Western Conference 's Southwest Division , and are hanging on to the eighth seed in the conference for the time being as well . They 're home again Friday to face the Golden State Warriors .
Boston held off Philadelphia 's strong start and claimed a resounding 112 - 95 victory in their home opener . The third pick of the 2015 draft , Jahlil Okafor , was the story of the game in his debut . He put up 26 points and seven rebounds on 10 - 16 shooting from the field and 6 - 6 from the line . The rookie also committed eight turnovers . Unfortunately , his effort was n't enough to keep the 76ers in the game . The other bright spot for the 76ers was second year forward Nerlens Noel , who filled up the stat sheet with 14 points , 12 rebounds , two assists , three steals , and two blocks in 35 minutes . Isaiah Canaan also chipped in 18 points and 7 rebounds . Philadelphia will welcome Utah into town Friday , and will look for their first win of the season . Isaiah Thomas led the way for Boston off the bench with 27 points and seven assists in 29 minutes of action . The Celtics front court looks to be a fluid situation to start the season with Tyler Zeller starting but only playing 10 minutes . Jared Sullinger and Amir Johnson played 21 and 20 minutes respectively off the bench , while newly aquired David Lee started and played 22 minutes . Boston will play at home again Friday versus Toronto and look to start the season 20 .
The Toronto Raptors ( 20 ) were able to pull away on the road from the Boston Celtics ( 1 - 1 ) in the second half of Friday’s game , winning by a score of 113 - 103 . The two teams were dead even through the first two quarters , as the score was tied 26 - 26 after the first 12 minutes and 54 - 54 at halftime . However , the Raptors eventually used an 80 run in the third quarter to gain separation from the opposition , and maintained that advantage over the final 15 minutes . Terrence Ross was a star performer off the bench for Toronto , notching 21 points on 8 - for - 12 shooting . DeMarre Carroll knocked down four three - pointers to finish with 21 points , while Kyle Lowry and DeMar DeRozan both shook off poor shooting nights to combine for 37 points . The Celtics were undone by the lack of scoring from their starting unit , as only two of the five starters reached double figures in scoring . That offensive deficiency was further exacerbated by the team’s ineffectiveness on the glass , with Toronto outrebounding Boston by a 53 - 38 count . For the second straight game , the Celtics leaned on Isaiah Thomas to drive the offense , and the guard didn’t disappoint with a team - leading 25 points and seven assists . Amir Johnson chipped in 11 points and eight boards off the bench , while fellow frontcourt reserve Kelly Olynyk contributed 11 points of his own . Toronto’s next game will come at home Sunday versus Milwaukee , while Boston will enjoy another home date that same day against San Antonio .
In their first of two matchups against the Boston Celtics ( 1 - 2 ) this season , the San_Antonio Spurs prevailed with a 95 - 87 win in Boston . First-year Spur LaMarcus Aldridge led the charge with 24 points , 12 rebounds , and five assists . The All-Star forward took advantage of the weak play of the Celtics ' big men , also tallying a block and a steal in 35 minutes of play . The game was a bounceback for Aldridge , who posted scoring totals of 11 and 10 in his first two games . San_Antonio 's froncourt was also bolstered by the performance of 24 - year - old forward Kawhi Leonard , who totaled 19 points and five rebounds to go along with a pair of steals and a block . Despite falling behind early , Boston was able to remain within reach throughout the game , due largely to the performances of a number of bench players . Backup big men Amir Johnson and Jared Sullinger provided a spark of the bench , recording ten points apiece . While sixth man Isaiah Thomas struggled with his shot , he was still able to contribute as a distributor , notching five assists in the game . The team as a whole had issues with efficiency , as they shot just 36 percent from the field through four quarters . Despite their rough shooting night , sophomore guard Marcus Smart proved a diamond in the rough for Boston , posting 17 points and showing off his highly - touted defense with four steals . The Spurs will look to carry the momentum from this game into Monday , as they take on the Knicks in New York . Boston , meanwhile , will enjoy two days of rest before taking to the road against Indiana on Wednesday .
The Indiana Pacers ( 5 - 4 ) defeated the Boston Celtics ( 3 - 4 ) 102 - 91 on Wednesday at the TD Garden in Boston . In a relatively sloppy game with 37 combined turnovers , it was the Pacers who were able to come into Boston and steal an 11 - point victory . They were the superior shooters as a team , going 48 percent from the field and 35 percent from the three - point line , while the Celtics shot just 41 percent from the field and a paltry 17 percent from beyond the arc . With the higher shooting percentages , as well as a 41 - 36 rebounding advantage , the Pacers were able to seal the win . Paul George 's re - emergence this season coninued Wednesday with a 26 - point ( 10 - 22 FG , 2 - 5 3Pt , 4 - 5 FT ) , 10 - rebound performance . George sat out all but six games last season with a broken leg , but is now putting up career numbers to start the year , averaging 24 points , 9 rebounds , 5 assists and 2 steals over 36 minutes per game . The double - double also marked his fifth on the young season already , so George is showing some serious production . C.J. Miles saw extended time with Rodney Stuckey out due to an ankle injury . He took advantage of the extra minutes , scoring 17 points ( 6 - 10 FG , 1 - 4 3Pt , 4 - 4 FT ) , to go along with five rebounds and two steals . In injury related news , the Pacers did see one of their top young prospects leave the game . Rookie Myles Turner suffered a sprained thumb in the first quarter and was forced to sit out the rest of the game . Marcus Smart made his much anticipated return to the court after sitting out the last three games due to a toe injury . Coach Brad Stevens had him come off the bench , where he struggled to just eight points ( 1 - 6 FG , 0 - 4 3Pt , 6 - 8 FT ) and two assists over 21 minutes . Considering Avery Bradley was sidelined with a leg injury as well , Isaiah Thomas and Evan Turner were the make - shift backcourt for the Celtics . They were the most productive players on the court , as Turner finished with 20 points ( 9 - 13 FG , 2 - 2 FT ) and three assists , while Thomas added 14 points ( 4 - 13 FG , 1 - 4 3Pt , 5 - 7 FT ) and four assists .

Jared Sullinger chipped in with an 11 - point ( 5 - 10 FG , 1 - 3 3Pt ) , 11 - rebound double - double as well . The Pacers ' next game will be at home against the Minnesota Timberwolves on Friday , while the Celtics will remain at home in a matchup with the Atlanta Hawks on Friday .
The Boston Celtics ( 21 - 19 ) defeated the Phoenix Suns ( 13 - 28 ) 117 - 103 on Friday . If the Celtics could get balanced efforts like these across their roster on a consistent basis , they would likely sport an even better record . Virtually every Boston player seemed to be hitting on all cylinders Friday , with seven managing double - digit scoring . They also received a double - double and a triple - double from Jared Sullinger and Marcus Smart , respectively , and outperformed the visitors in every major offensive and defensive category . The Celtics cruised to a 68 - 47 halftime lead , before finishing things out in the second half for their largest margin of victory since Dec. 22 against the Timberwolves . The Suns ' leading scorer came from the bench , as Mirza Teletovic continued his solid stretch of offensive play .

For Boston , the win was the second half of a back - to - back after Milwaukee snapped the team 's four - game win streak on Tuesday .

It proved to be a point guard battle , as All-Star Isaiah Thomas led the team with a season - high 36 points while also dishing out 11 assists . Big man Jared Sullinger also had one of his strongest outings of the season , scoring 21 points on 10 - for - 15 shooting while also pulling down 11 rebounds and notching seven assists .

Redick also had a big night , scoring 27 points . Both teams will enjoy a long rest as the NBA heads into the All-Star break this weekend .
The Houston Rockets ( 33 - 32 ) defeated the host Boston Celtics ( 39 - 27 ) 102 - 98 , Friday evening at TD Garden . The Rockets entered looking to improved on their three - game lead over Utah for eighth in the West and did just that as they edged the Boston Celtics down the stretch . The Rockets have now won three straight on the road , including victories against top eastern teams , Toronto and now Boston . The Celtics had won their previous 14 games at TD Garden and had won seven of nine against the West coming into this game , but the Rockets managed to defy those trends as they snuck away with the win . Houston struggled shooting from deep in this one , hitting only 5 - 26 from long range and gave up 18 turnovers on the game ; but on the other hand managed to keep the Celtics to just 37 percent shooting from the field . James Harden led all scorers as he finished with 32 points ( 9 - 19 FG , 1 - 6 3Pt , 13 - 15 FT ) , along with four assists , three rebounds , one steal and one block . However , Harden also gave up six turnovers in his 36 minutes on the court . Michael Beasley was huge in his second game with the Rockets , providing a solid boost off the bench . Beasley tallied 18 points ( 9 - 19 FG ) and eight rebounds , in only 15 minutes , as the second highest scorer for the Houston . Dwight Howard was solid in the middle , with 12 points and 12 rebounds , in 35 minutes . Despite playing at home where they have had great success , the Celtics were not able to gather much momentum in this one . The Celtics averaged 112 points per game throughout their previous 14 home victories but were held much below that mark by a hungry Houston team . Meanwhile , Isaiah Thomas was not phased as he tallied a team - high 30 points ( 10 - 21 FG , 5 - 9 3Pt , 5 - 6 FT ) , along with two assists and two rebounds , in 38 minutes . Jared Sullinger had a big night as well , with 24 points ( 9 - 18 FG , 1 - 1 3Pt , 5 - 7 FT ) , 12 rebounds , four assists and four steals , in 31 minutes , while Avery Bradley chipped in 16 points , in 38 minutes .

The Boston Celtics ( 41 - 30 ) earned a home win against the Orlando Magic ( 29 - 41 ) Monday night at TD Garden , 107 - 96 . Five Celtics finished in double figures and three went over 20 points as the Celtics offense largely had its way with the Orlando defense . Boston shot a robust 33 - 63 ( 52 percent ) from inside the arc and shot 20 - 24 from the free throw line , good for a seven - point free throw advantage over the Magic . The Orlando offense , meanwhile , was stagnant , as they assisted on just 15 baskets and turned the ball over 11 times . Isaiah Thomas 's 28 points led all scorers , and he added seven assists , five rebounds and a steal . Avery Bradley scored 22 points ( 9 - 15 FG ) and added nine rebounds , and Kelly Olynyk scored 22 of his own in just 21 minutes off the bench behind a hugely efficient shooting night ( 7 - 12 FG , 4 - 6 3PT , 4 - 4 FT ) . Boston shot just 7 - 22 ( 32 percent ) from the three - point line but was sharp enough in the rest of their offensive game to overcome the poor outside shooting . Victor Oladipo 's 25 points led the Magic . The point guard shot 10 - 17 from the field and added a team - high eight rebounds and five steals . Evan Fournier , Aaron gordon and Andrew Nicholson were the only other Magic players to top double - digits , as they scored 13 points apiece . Orlando shot just 42 percent from the floor and a brutal 5 - 18 ( 28 percent ) from three - point land , as they never were able to generate the offense to compete in this one . The Magic head to Detroit for a Wednesday matchup against the Pistons . The Celtics continue their homestand Wednesday against the Raptors .
The Houston Rockets defeated the Los_Angeles Clippers 109 - 105 on Saturday . The Rockets made an epic 3 - 1 comeback in last seasons playoffs against the Clippers and they showed here that the comenack was no fluke by winnin a big game on the road . The demise of James Harden was well publicized last week and it was downright wrong , as he put together another huge game on Saturday . The Clippers played this game without point guard Chris Paul who was dealing with a groin injury and that clearly hampered them here in the loss . Houston started off the season with three - straight 20 - point losses , but they appear to be out of that swoon at this point with four - straight wins . They have scored 110 points or more in all four wins and that can be attributed to James Hardan taking over the offense . Harden is clearly back to top form , as he has dropped 89 points over the last two nights . This was the second half of a back - to - back and it 's a great sign for Houston to see them play so well in that scenario against a team like the Clippers . They even got to rest Dwight Howard on Friday night and that proved to be crucial for this game , as he tallied 20 points and 20 rebounds in the win . The Rockets will have a few days off and look to keep that winning - streak alive against the winless Brooklyn Nets on Wednesday , The Clippers had to play this game without their point guard Chris Paul and it was just too difficult for them to function fully without their playmaker . Austin Rivers filled in for Paul and put up 10 points and one assist in the loss . The Clippers were led Blake Griffin , who totaled 35 points , 11 rebounds and five assists in the loss . One stat that coach Doc Rivers will love is that all 10 players who played more than a single a minute in this game recorded an assist in the absence of assist - master Chris Paul . The next game on tap for the Clippers is against the struggling Memphis Grizzlies on Monday .
The Los_Angeles Clippers ( 5 - 2 ) just squeezed by with a win on Monday night versus the Memphis Grizzlies ( 3 - 5 ) by a score of 94 - 92 . This gritty , grind - it - out game came right down to the wire , as Marc Gasol missed a free throw in the last few seconds that would have tied the game after a very late Grizzlies rally . Neither team had much help off the bench , as this game was primarily a battle of two of the league 's best starting frontcourts . Zach Randolph led the Grizzlies in scoring and rebounding , with 26 points and nine boards . He added four assists and three steals in 39 minutes . Gasol added 18 points , seven rebounds , and three assists . Mike Conley gave the Grizzlies good guard play with 16 points , six rebounds , five assists , and one steal , but did n't have much help in terms of backcourt scoring . Courtney Lee had only six points , but still dished five assists and grabbed three steals . Matt Barnes had a bit of a chip on his shoulder after being let go by the Clippers and played hard against his old team , tallying eight points , six rebounds , two steals and two blocks . The frontcourt combo of Blake Griffin and DeAndre Jordan proved superior in this Western Conference showdown . Griffin had a solid game with 24 points and 12 rebounds , while Jordan scored 13 points and grabbed 12 rebounds . Jordan also added four blocks . Chris Paul and J.J. Redick both contributed double - digit scoring , with Paul providing 14 points and Redick supplying 16 . Up next for Memphis will be a match with the undefeated Golden State Warriors . The Clippers will be at Dallas on Wednesday to face the Mavs .
The Toronto Raptors ( 9 - 6 ) defeated the Los_Angeles Clippers ( 6 - 7 ) 91 - 80 on Sunday . Throughout a difficult start to the season that has included multi - game injuries to starters Chris Paul and J.J. Redick , the Clippers have been able to lean on Blake Griffin as a dependable source of outstanding production . Sunday , even Griffin succumbed to the malaise that currently seems to surround Los_Angeles , mustering a season - low nine points , along with six rebounds , four assists and a pair of steals . He also turned the ball over a season - high six times in a forgettable performance versus a Raptors defense that had been vulernable to opposing power forwards coming into the game . Toronto enjoyed impressive contributions from every starter , with DeMarre Carroll and DeMar DeRozan leading the way with a pair of 21 - point efforts . Kyle Lowry pitched in with his second double - double of the season ( 13 points , 10 assists ) , while veteran power forward Luis Scola continued a resurgent age - 35 season with 20 points and eight rebounds . It was the second outing with 20 or more points for Scola in his last three contests .

Toronto improved to 9 - 6 and remains in first place in the Eastern Conference 's Atlantic Division . They head home for a date with the Cavaliers on Wednesday . The Clippers received rather pedestrian offensive efforts from other starters besides Griffin as well . Redick managed a team - high 17 points in his second game back from a back injury , while Paul and DeAndre Jordan pitched in with solid but relatively modest double - double performances . Paul poured in 13 points and dished out 11 assists , while Jordan posted 13 points and hauled in 15 boards . Paul Pierce received a start at small forward but could only muster a paltry two points and one rebound in 19 minutes on the floor .

Jamal Crawford busted out of his shooting slump after scoring 32 points on 10 - of - 19 from the field in the winning effort . Crawford was essential in leading the Clippers’ comeback after trailing 91 - 80 . A pair of 3 - pointers , in addition to a driving , finger roll layup was enough to overtake the lead with just over two minutes remaining in the 4th quarter . Blake Griffin added a clutch jump shot from the free throw line down the stretch and finished with 28 points , 13 rebounds and seven assists in 39 minutes . DeAndre Jordan dominated the glass adding 14 rebounds and 15 points . The Clippers were without point guard Chris Paul ( ribs ) and looked sloppy on the offensive end at times behind fill in starter , Austin Rivers , who contributed five points and four rebounds . The Magic played a pesky defensive game and saw effective performances from young players Victor Oladipo and Elfrid Payton , as the backcourt finished with a combined 45 points . The Magic were unable to get a good look down the stretch and had no answer for Jamal Crawford’s lights out shooting , even after taking a double digit lead in the 4th quarter . Tobias Harris and Nikola Vucevic added 10 points each , while Channing Frye and Evan Fournier were unable to find a rhythm , finishing with three points and seven points , respectively . Aaron Gordon finished with 10 points in 21 minutes off the bench , to go along with seven rebounds on 5 - of - 8 shooting .

The Sacramento Kings ( 17 - 23 ) defeated the Los_Angeles Clippers ( 26 - 14 ) at Staples Center on Saturday , 110 - 103 . Sacramento battled through foul trouble early on , but shot lights out from the behind the arc to sink the Clippers and their 10 game winning streak . The importance of 3 - point shooting continues to surge in the NBA , and efficient shooting from deep is becoming a sure fire way to stop even the best of teams .

The Clippers will look to bounce back when they host the Houston Rockets ( 21 - 20 ) on Monday .
The Los_Angeles Clippers ( 31 - 16 ) beat the Los_Angeles Lakers ( 9 - 40 ) 105 - 93 on Friday . In what shaped to be a blowout , the Lakers hung around much longer than expected .

The turnover differential was huge , as the Clippers committed just eight turnovers , while drawing 17 from the Lakers . The Clippers also dominated the rebounding , as they snatched down 48 boards to the Lakers 38 . The Clippers bench was outstanding as well , as they outscored the Lakers bench 56 - 25 .

The Los_Angeles Clippers ( 32 - 16 ) defeated the Chicago Bulls ( 26 - 20 ) 120 - 93 on Sunday . The score would indicate a lopsided game , but it was close until the second half . The Clippers outscored the Bulls by 23 over the final 24 minutes and much of that has to be attributed to the lights - out shooting . The Clippers went 17 - for - 32 from three - point range and shot 54 percent from the field in the win . The bench production was huge as well , as Los_Angeles got 58 bench points to Chicago 's 18 . The Bulls went scoreless for the last five minutes of the game and that was indicative of their recent form . Chicago has now lost eight of their last 12 games and a performance like this doesn’t bode well for the future .

The Los_Angeles Clippers ( 40 - 20 ) defeated the Oklahoma_City Thunder ( 42 - 19 ) 103 - 98 at Staples Center on Wednesday . A tale of two halves between a pair of the Western Conference’s best teams , and one that pointed towards a Thunder rout from the get go . Oklahoma_City stormed out to a twenty point lead behind Russell Westbrook and Kevin Durant , which has been the theme of their season so far . The scoring outbursts from the two all - stars eventually went cold when it mattered most , as Los_Angeles rallied behind Wesley Johnson’s three point shooting and superb defense and DeAndre Jordan’s smooth touch at the rim . Chris Paul and company needed a miracle to make the comeback , and that miracle was granted after Jordan made two free throws , as part of two possessions that sent him to the free throw line the old fashioned way . With just under 5:0 remaining in the fourth quarter , Johnson drained back - to - back treys to pull within eight points of the Thunder . Add in a trio of layups from Jamal Crawford , Jordan and Paul ( in that order ) , and the Clippers found themselves down just two points . Kevin Durant broke the cold streak with 2:0 remaining , but the aforementioned Jordan and - 1’s came on the following possessions and the Clippers didn’t look back , capping off the 22 point comeback and resilient victory . Durant led all scorers with 30 points , to go along with 11 rebounds , five assists and five blocks , while Westbrook , who’s shot selection late in the game became strange , finished with 24 points , six rebounds and 12 assists . Serge Ibaka pitched in a double - double with 11 points and 11 boards , and the Thunder bench was led by Enes Kanter’s eight points and eight rebounds . On the Clippers end , it was Paul’s unselfish leadership , as he finished with 21 points , four rebounds and 13 assists . Johnson deserves a lot of credit down the stretch , as he pestered Kevin Durant with fabulous defense , and scored 11 points off the bench . The volume shot selection was not the best of choice , seeing as he took 16 shots , but the ones that fell came at the right time to bail out the 4 - of - 16 shooting . Jordan nailed his free throws when they mattered most and totaled 20 points and 18 rebounds . The Thunder will head north to cap off a brutal back - to - back against the Golden State Warriors ( 54 - 5 ) on Thursday , while the Clippers will enjoy a few days off before hosting the Atlanta Hawks ( 33 - 28 ) on Saturday .

Los_Angeles was great from long distance as well , as they went 13 - for - 29 in the win . New_York is in the midst of a rough stretch right now , but this was a great performance despite the result .

The Los_Angeles Clippers ( 46 - 27 ) defeated the Boston Celtics ( 43 - 31 ) 114 - 90 at Staples Center on Monday . Both the Clippers and Celtics control the 4 - seed in their respective conferences , but Los_Angeles proved once again that the elite teams in the Western Conference are more overpowering than the elite teams in the Eastern Conference . Isiah Thomas and company physically battled their way through the first quarter , but still came out six points down , and the Clippers simply built on their lead during the rest of the game . Thomas chased down Chris Paul in transition for a highlight block , but it did not get any prettier than that for his team . The Clippers bench proved to be the difference in the game , as the starters failed to provide much offense . Jamal Crawford , Jeff Green , Wesley Johnson and Austin Rivers all finished in double figures , while Chris Paul dished out 14 assists and DeAndre Jordan commanded the paint and added 13 rebounds . Shot selection was key for the bench roles , as Los_Angeles drained 52 percent of their shots and dished out 29 assists . Paul’s assist total matched that of the entire Celtics team . Isiah Thomas found success attacking the rim and did most of his damage from the free throw line . The all - star point guard finished with 24 points to lead all scorers ( 5 - of - 14 FG , 12 - of - 13 FT ) and two assists . Avery Bradley and Marcus Smart were the only other Celtics to join Thomas in double figures , which was unsurprising given the defensive effort and size they were matched up against . Boston shot a lowly 35 percent from the field and got very little production from their bench . The Clippers will visit the Minnesota Timberwolves ( 25 - 49 ) on Wednesday , while the Celtics will head north to take on the Portland Trail Blazers ( 39 - 36 ) on Thursday .
The Memphis Grizzlies ( 8 - 7 ) defeated the Dallas Mavericks ( 9 - 6 ) 110 - 96 on Tuesday .

A big positive , however , for Houston was recent bench acquisition Michael Beasley . The former second overall pick and reigning Chinese Basketball Association MVP dropped 30 points and pulled nine rebounds in 28 minutes off the bench . Houston will visit OKC on Tuesday , while Atlanta will host Washington on Monday .
The Atlanta Hawks ( 46 - 32 ) defeated the Phoenix Suns ( 20 - 59 ) Tuesday night at Phillips Arena , 103 - 90 . Phoenix exploded to a 10 - point lead with a 38 - point first quarter and entered halftime with a 12 - point lead . But the Suns offense could n't maintain the pace , as they could n't reach 20 points in any of the final three quarters . The Hawks chipped away throughout the second half . Atlanta opened the fourth quarter on a 12 - 2 run to turn a 73 - 70 deficit into an 82 - 75 lead , and they would n't give it up . Jeff Teague 's 20 points led the Hawks as he knocked down three of his seven three - point attempts . The Hawks got double - doubles from Paul Millsap ( 13 points , 17 rebounds , eight assists ) and Al Horford ( 16 points , 10 rebounds ) . Kent Bazemore nearly added a third , as he poured in 17 points ( 7 - 13 FG , 2 - 5 3PT ) , grabbed nine rebounds , dished five assists and swiped five steals . Atlanta shot just 41 percent from the floor , but they were active both on the offensive glass ( 13 offensive rebounds ) and in the passing lanes ( 16 steals ) , and that allowed them to nab the win despite lacking their shooting touch . Devin Booker made the Suns offense go , as he scored a game - high 34 points on a ludicrously efficient 12 - 25 shooting night , including 4 - 9 from deep . Booker added five rebounds , two assists and two steals and turned the ball over just twice despite using over 30 possessions . He got little help , though , as Ronnie Price was Phoenix 's second leading scorer with 14 points ( 4 - 9 FG , 4 - 7 3PT ) . Price committed seven turnovers , however , and the Suns were sloppy all night , as Phoenix committed 24 turnovers and managed just 19 assists . The Hawks continue their homestand Thursday against the Raptors . The Suns continue their road trip Thursday against the Rockets .
The Miami Heat ( 6 - 3 ) defeated the Utah Jazz ( 4 - 4 ) 92 - 91 on Thursday . Both teams played without key pieces , as Dwyane Wade was forced to miss the contest due to a family matter , while Rudy Gobert was unable to shake off the effects of the rolled ankle he suffered versus the Cavaliers on Tuesday . In their absences , Chris Bosh and Derrick Favors elevated their already impressive games and put their respective teams’ offenses on their shoulders . Bosh filled the stat sheet with 25 points , eight rebounds , four assists , and four blocks , including a key stuff at the basket on a driving Alec Burks late in the fourth quarter . Meanwhile , Favors posted a 25 - point,12 - rebound double - double that also included an eye - popping seven blocks , three steals , and a pair of assists . Favors’ gargantuan effort was supplemented by another excellent performance from Alec Burks off the Jazz bench . The fifth - year pro tallied his second consecutive 24 - point performance on a season - high 35 minutes . Gordon Hayward enjoyed a 24 - point night of his own , which marked a season high in scoring for the sixth - year pro . Unfortunately for Utah , starting shooting guard Rodney Hood was the only other player able to score in double figures , and he barely reached the benchmark with only 10 points . The Jazz dropped to 4 - 4 and currently reside in third place in the Western Conference’s Northwest Division , pending the outcome of the ongoing Warriors-Timberwolves contest . They make the trek north for a road tilt versus Orlando on Friday . In addition to Bosh’s standout night , Tyler Johnson rivaled Burks with a strong performance in a reserve role himself , pouring in 17 points and chipping in four rebounds , three assists , two blocks , and a steal . Johnson’s efficient night helped to make up for the loss of Wade , as did Goran Dragic’s strong first - half performance . The Heat point guard was much quieter in the second half , but did make a couple of key free throws late in the game to finish as the only other Miami player with double - digit scoring ( 14 points ) . The Heat improves to 6 - 3 on the season and remains in second place behind the Atlanta Hawks in the Eastern Conference’s Southeast Division . They now benefit from four full days off before facing the Minnesota Timberwolves next Tuesday .
The Miami Heat ( 7 - 4 ) defeated the Sacramento Kings ( 4 - 9 ) 116 - 109 on Thursday . The Kings found out earlier in the afternoon that they 'd lost starting power forward DeMarcus Cousins for the night , due to a suspension stemming from his forearm shot on Al Horford in Wednesday night 's contest versus the Hawks . The ripple effect of his absence brought Kosta Koufos and Omri Casspi into the starting lineup for Sacramento , which could have used their All-Star big man , particularly during a valiant effort to close their deficit in the second half . Although they found themselves in a 56 - 46 hole at the half , the Kings did finish with a healthy total of 109 points due to a number of valuable contributions across the lineup . Rajon Rondo held up his end of the bargain trying to keep the Kings offense running on all cylinders , coming within a rebound of a second consecutive triple - double and fourth in five games . The veteran point guard poured in 14 points and 18 assists , while hauling in nine boards for good measure . Rudy Gay supported Rondo 's effort with a double - double performance of his own , posting 13 points , 12 rebounds , a pair of assists , and a steal . Meanwhile , Casspi played a season - high 39 minutes and was productive with the extended court time , chipping in with a 16 - point , six - rebound effort . Ben McLemore continued to show signs of offensive life after a rough start to the season , amassing double - digit points ( 17 ) for the second consecutive night . Notably , Marco Belinelli contributed a season - high 23 points off the bench in a highly efficient 26 minutes . The Kings fell to 4 - 9 and currently reside in fourth place in the Western Conference 's Pacific Division . They next head to Orlando for a date with the Magic on Saturday . The Heat benefited from strong bounce - back efforts from their two veteran stars , Chris Bosh and Dwyane Wade . The All-Stars had each suffered through middling performances versus the Timberwolves on Tuesday , but took advantage of their respective favorable matchups against Sacramento . Free of having to bump bodies with Cousins all night , Bosh posted 23 points , 11 rebounds , four assists and a block in one of his most complete performances of the year . Wade stuffed the stat sheet as well , amassing 24 points , six assists , five rebounds and a pair of steals against the Kings ' vulnerable shooting guard defense . Hassan Whiteside had a relatively quiet game by his standards and could n't get on the stat sheet until well into the second quarter , but finished with a respectable 12 points , five rebounds , a pair of steals and four more blocks . Much like his Kings shooting guard counterpart Belinelli , Tyler Johnson turned in an impressive performance in a reserve role for Miami , pacing the Heat bench with 19 points over 25 minutes . The Heat improved to 7 - 4 and remain in second place in the Eastern Conference 's Southeast Division . They remain home for a showdown with the Sixers on Saturday .
The Miami Heat ( 8 - 4 ) held off the Philadelphia 76ers ( 0 - 14 ) to win 96 - 91 on Saturday . This was the Sixers best chance at a win all season , but they couldn’t quite hold off the Heat . Miami ended the game on a 20 - 4 run and held the Sixers to one basket over the final seven - plus minutes . Not to mention , that one basket was a meaningless one with just seconds left in the game . The Heat held the Sixers to 38 percent shooting and blocked 14 shots in the win . Philadelphia 's bench was a bright spot though , as they outscored Miami 's bench 47 to 26 . This was a rough loss in a disastrous season for Philadelphia . They had a big lead early , but simply couldn’t hold on . They did get two great bench performances , as Robert Covington dropped 21 points while Isiah Caanan dropped 22 points . Philadelphia 's best player on this night was rookie Jahlil Okafor , who tallied 16 points , 11 rebounds and three steals en route to a double - double . The rookie now leads the team in scoring and is second on the team in rebounding . They might have their best chance at a win when they take on the equally - young Minnesota Timberwolves on Monday . The Heat looked horrible in the first half , but leaned on their stifling defense to pull out a big win . Miami got an outstanding performance from Dwyane Wade , who tallied 27 points , seven rebounds , four assists and three steals in the victory . Hassan Whiteside also had a great game , as he collected 13 points , nine rebounds and eight blocks in the win . Those eight blocks add to his already league - leading total and he 's truly playing at a different level this season than years past . This is one of the best defenses in the NBA right now and they showed why on Saturday . Miami will look to keep up their strong defense against the surging New York Knicks on Monday .
The Toronto Raptors ( 17 - 11 ) defeated the Miami Heat ( 15 - 10 ) by a score of 108 - 94 , Friday night in Miami . The game was tight in the beginning , with Miami up five going into the half . Toronto came out of the dressing room ready to compete and outscored the Heat 58 - 39 the rest of the way . This was a big win for the Raptors who were coming off losses to two top Eastern teams , Indiana and Charlotte . The Raptors would have been asking questions had they lost this one too , however they managed to snap the Heat 's three - game winning streak and get back on track with the W. Toronto shot strong percentages all around , going 51 percent from the field , 81 percent from the free throw line and a better - than - average 38 percent from the beyond the arc . The Raptors also took care of the ball very well , only giving up seven turnovers on the game . DeMar DeRozan made sure his team did not drop three straight by offering up 30 points on strong shooting ( 10 - 17 FG , 10 - 13 FT ) . DeRozan also logged four rebounds , four assists and two steals , in a hefty 40 minutes . Kyle Lowry was big as well with 21 points , four assists , three rebounds and four steals , in 37 minutes . Luis Scola chipped in 20 points of his own , on 9 - 16 shooting . Terrence Ross was efficient off the bench with 17 points ( 6 - 9 FG , 5 - 8 3Pt ) . DeMarre Carroll remained out with a knee contusion . Miami shot the ball reasonably well but lost the rebounding battle and also gave up six more turnovers than their competition , a combination that will not lead to many wins . Dwyane Wade led the Heat in scoring with 21 points ( 8 - 16 FG , 5 - 5 FT ) , along with six assists and four rebounds . Wade however gave up eight turnovers , in 31 minutes . Gerald Green gave the Heat a great spark off the bench , as usual , finishing with 20 points . Green shot a blistering 5 - 10 from beyond the arc and went 7 - 15 over - all from the field .

Coming into this game the Pacers were 20 in the season series against the Heat and it looked like they would get their third win of the series as they were up by 18 with five minutes to go in the third . However , Miami put on their rally caps and came all the way back to take their first lead with about three and a half minutes to go in the fourth . After a dramatic final 58 seconds the Heat found themselves down by two , with two seconds left and a side inbound .

New_York has now won three in a row , and sits just one game shy of .500 . The Knicks ' efforts were bolstered , as always , by the play of superstar Carmelo Anthony . After posting a big double - double in Atlanta , Melo continued to shine as he dropped in 25 points to go with five rebounds and four assists . Offseason acquisition Robin Lopez also posted an impressive 19 points on 9 - for - 12 shooting . Highly-publicized rookie Kristaps Porzingis , however , had an underwhelming night , posting just 10 points and four rebounds on 3 - of - 10 shooting .

The Oklahoma_City Thunder ( 9 - 6 ) showed the up and coming Utah Jazz ( 6 - 7 ) who is boss , with a definitive 111 - 89 victory on Monday night . The Thunder had control most of the way as they held the lead from the beginning of the second quater until the final whistle . They scored 40 points in the second quarter to establish a sustainable cushion and lead to a solid win . Kevin Durant was back in the line up for the Thunder after sitting out a few games with a hamstring injury .

The Utah Jazz ( 8 - 8 ) came very close to toppling the Golden_State Warriors ( 190 ) but the multi - pronged attack of the Warriors had the answer as they earned the victory and stayed perfect by beating the Jazz 106 - 103 . Utah took the lead with 7:30 left in the fourth quarter after an 11 - 2 run but that is when Stephen Curry and the Warriors kicked it into another gear . Curry seemed to have an answer for almost every Utah bucket and when he missed a contested lay - up in the last minutes Draymond Green was there to clean up the mess . Derrick Favors had a great game for the Jazz and was clutch in the last few minutes . He finished with 23 points on 9 - 15 shooting , including 5 - 5 free throws , 10 rebounds , two assists and two steals . Gordon Hayward also performed well , totalling a team - high 24 points , along with six assists and four rebounds , in 37 minutes .

Alec Burks was big 28 minutes off the bench , with 19 points on 8 - 15 shooting , two rebounds , two assists and two steals . The Warriors were forced to play this one right down to the wire and would have lost if Utah had hit their last second open shot attempt . Stephen Curry led the way in scoring for Golden_State with 26 points on 9 - 20 shooting , 4 - 8 from downtown , six rebounds , five assists and two steals . Draymond Green contributed in many ways including 20 points , nine rebounds , seven assists and immeasurable hustle and energy .

Utah will have a couple of days off before hosting Orlando on Thursday .
The Utah Jazz ( 9 - 9 ) defeated the Indiana Pacers ( 12 - 7 ) 122 - 119 on Saturday . The Pacers trailed by 17 points in the 3rd quarter , but a red hot Paul George sparked a sharpshooting comeback in the final period . George finished the night with a career high 48 points on 15 - of - 27 shooting , to go along with eight rebounds and three assists . The No . 10 overall pick from the 2010 draft added eight 3 - pointers in the effort , and matched up against Gordon Hayward , who was taken ninth overall in that same draft , which made for a competitive one - on - one battle throughout the evening . Rodney Stuckey finished second in scoring for the Pacers , contributing 23 points off the bench , including a clutch jump shot with just over a minute remaining in regulation to extend the Pacers lead by three . Jordan Hill and George Hill added 10 points each , while starters Ian Mahinmi and Monta Ellis finished with six points a piece . While Paul George could not be contained , the Jazz answered with Derrick Favors , who contributed 35 points and 13 rebounds , including the game tying layup with 10 seconds left in the 4th quarter . Favors extended the momentum into the overtime period by making his way to the free throw line and playing a physical game underneath the rim . The Jazz were without Rudy Gobert ( knee ) and missed out on his defensive efficiency , specifically in the blocks category . Gordon Hayward finished with 22 points , five rebounds and five assists on 5 - of - 14 shooting . Trey Burke is becoming more confident in his jump shot , evidenced by his eight buckets in 33 minutes off the bench , as he finished with 19 points and seven assists . Raul Neto may find himself on the highlight reel after making a ridiculous circus shot , after contact , in the first half and contributed 13 points in 18 minutes . Both teams play on Tuesday , with the Pacers returning home to face the undefeated Golden State Warriors ( 210 ) , while the Jazz visit the Sacramento Kings ( 7 - 14 ) .
The Utah Jazz ( 10 - 10 ) dismantled the New_York Knicks ( 10 - 13 ) to the tune of a 106 - 85 scoreline on Wednesday . The Jazz took care of this game early and never allowed the Knicks to fight their way back in it . In fact , Utah was up 49 - 18 in the first 15 minutes and took a 25 - point lead into the half . Utah shot over 50 percent from the field in the first half and amazingly did not commit a turnover until 28 minutes into the game . The Jazz held the Knicks to under 40 percent shooting in the win as well . The Jazz have been playing horrible defense since Rudy Gobert got injured , but they were great here . They held the Knicks starters to just 31 points in the win and allowed just 11 points in the opening quarter . Gordon Hayward and Derrick Favors carried the load once again . Hayward tallied 24 points , four rebounds and five assists in the victory . Favors recorded 20 points and eight boards to fall just shy of his fourth - straight double - double . Utah had allowed an average over 110 points per game without Gobert in the lineup , so this defensive performance is a great sign going forward . The Jazz have a much tougher test in their next game , when they host the Oklahoma City Thunder on Friday . The Knicks were stifled in this game and really didn’t muster up anything until it was too late . No player scored more than 12 points and that 's simply a bad recipe to win a game . Carmelo Anthony led the team with 12 points and five rebounds . Phenom rookie Kristaps Porzingis had one of his worst games of his short career , as he could only provide four points and three rebounds on 2 - for - 8 shooting . This is just one of those game for the Knicks and they can just chalk it up to playing in a tough environment against a stifling defense . They 'll look to bounce - back when they take on the Sacramento Kings on Thursday in the second half of a back - to - back set
The Utah Jazz ( 16 - 20 ) defeated the Miami Heat 98 - 83 in a slow - paced game on Saturday night With a score like that , most people would assume that the shooting was terrible , but that wasn’t the case . The Jazz actually shot 55 percent from the field , but took just 71 shots in total . The Heat shot 42 percent on 82 attempts and the teams combined for just 35 free - throws . Those are surprisingly low numbers considering the shooting percentages and it was clear the teams wanted to go to their primary identities and slow the game down to rely on their defenses . The Heat took a 10 - point lead after the first quarter , but the Jazz really turned it on after that . In fact , they held Miami to just 54 points in the final three quarters and outscored them by 25 points . The Heat came into this in the second half of a back - to - back and it clearly hampered them here . They got off to a hot start , but didn’t have the legs late to pull out a win against a defensively potent team . Dwyane Wade notoriously struggles in back - to - backs and that was the case here , as he shot just 3 - for - 17 to accumulate eight points , five rebounds and four assists . Chris Bosh had a nice game though , as he tallied 24 points and seven rebounds against a dominant frontline . The passing was a big problem for Miami , as the Heat recorded just 14 assists in the loss . It wo n't get any easier in their next game , as they have to travel to Oakland to take on a Golden State Warriors team that has just two losses on Monday . Utah got back to what they do best here and stifled the Heat en route to a big win . The star of the night was Gordon Hayward , who scored 34 points in a fantastic performance . Chris Johnson made a spot start here for the injured Rodney Hood and played great , accumulating 14 points , four rebounds , three assists , two blocks and two steals in 31 minutes . Rudy Gobert got his first start in quite some time as well and swatted away four shots despite failing to reach double - figures in points or rebounds . Injuries have really been hurting this team , but the more healthy they get , the scary they 're getting . This is the front end of a back - to - back , as the Jazz will play the Los Angeles Lakers on Sunday in their next game .
The Dallas Mavericks ( 42 - 39 ) secured seventh place in the Western Conference as they defeated the host Utah Jazz ( 40 - 41 ) on Monday evening , 101 - 92 , at Vivint Smart Home Arena . While securing Dallas ' spot in the post - season , this result leaves Utah 's status up in the air , as the Jazz are now tied with the Houston Rockets for the final playoff spot in the West . Houston holds the tie - breaker over Utah and therefore , in order for the Jazz to make it into the post - season they will need to win their next game and hope that the Rockets lose their final game . The Mavericks led just about the whole way en route to their eighth win in nine games and fourth straight on the road . Deron Williams led the way for Dallas , with 23 points ( 9 - 16 FG , 2 - 6 3Pt , 3 - 3 FT ) , along with six assists , four rebounds and one steal , in 37 minutes . Dirk Nowitzki was big as he tallied 22 points ( 7 - 12 FG , 4 - 7 3Pt , 4 - 4 FT ) , 11 rebounds , three assists , one steal and one blocked shot , in 32 minutes . Wesley Matthews followed up with 20 points , in 38 minutes . The Mavs shot 44 percent from the field and limited themselves to nine turnovers . The Jazz fought right down to the wire but fell for the third time in a row on their home court . Gordon Hayward poured in a game - high 26 points ( 11 - 21 FG , 1 - 9 3Pt , 3 - 4 FT ) , along with six rebounds , four assists and one blocked shot , in 40 minutes . Shelvin Mack added 18 points ( 8 - 14 FG , 2 - 7 3Pt ) , two rebounds and two assists , while Derrick Favors chipped in 11 points , in 28 minutes off the bench . Favors played limited minutes in his return , after missing one game with a sore knee . The Jazz will look to do their part in securing a post - season berth as they visit Los Angeles to play the Lakers on Wednesday . The Mavericks will finish off their season at home , when they host the San Antonio Spurs on Wednesday .
The Boston Celtics ( 11 - 8 ) defeated the Sacramento Kings ( 7 - 13 ) 114 - 97 on Thursday in Mexico City . Boston outscored Sacramento 32 - 17 in the first quarter and the game was never competitive after that . The frustration clearly boiled over for this Kings team , as Rajon Rondo was ejected in the third quarter . The Celtics came into this game as one of the best assisting teams in the NBA and that proved to be the difference , as they outassisted the Kings 34 - 21 . Boston also shot 48 percent from the field , while Sacramento shot just 38 percent . Boston came into this game as the more well - rounded team with less talent and the teamwork prevailed yet again . While DeMarcus Cousins , Rajon Rondo and Rudy Gay were likely the three best players on the floor , the Celtics are simply a better team . In fact , four players on the Celtics scored at least 20 points and this was an all - around great team effort . It was a revenge game for Isaiah Thomas and he was fantastic , tallying 21 points , nine assists , six rebounds and four steals in the win . Kelly Olynyk also had a nice game off the bench , as he collected 21 points , four rebounds and four assists in the victory . Boston will have a great test in their next game when they take on the San Antonio Spurs on Saturday . The Kings had a rough night in Mexico City and they 'll be happy to get out of there . Rondo was ejected in the third quarter for two technical fouls and it was a bit of a surprise he was the only one with all the frustration the Kings showed . DeMarcus Cousins had a lackluster game , as he tallied just 16 points , seven rebounds and four assists while battling foul trouble . The best player for Sacramento on this night was Rudy Gay , who contributed 18 points and seven rebounds in the loss . The Kings will look to bounce - back when they take on the Houston Rockets on Saturday in what should be a high - scoring bonanza .
The Sacramento Kings ( 10 - 15 ) defeated the Houston Rockets ( 12 - 14 ) 107 - 97 in a sloppy game on Tuesday . In a battle of two of the worst defenses in the NBA , the offenses played poorly . It 's not like the defenses played well either , as Houston shot just 41 percent from the field . Sacramento did shoot 51 percent , but committed an ugly 28 turnovers in the win . There were a combined 30 steals and 49 turnovers in the game and those are not far off from NBA records . The Rockets came into this game in the second half of a back - to - back and they played tired . There were numerous possessions where players were standing around and way too many defensive lapses when there was simply no defense being played at all . The team was outrebounded 47 to 36 and shot just 31 percent from three - point range . Those are indications of a tired team , but the effort simply wasn’t there . James Harden was spectacular yet again though , as he tallied 33 points , seven rebounds and six assists in the defeat . Houston will have a good opportunity to bounce back when they take on the Los Angeles Lakers on Thursday in their next game . It 's not too often a team commits 28 turnovers and wins , but the Kings managed to pull that off somehow on Tuesday . They played without Rajon Rondo , but all the other starters filled - in nicely in his absence . Darren Collison was the starting point guard for this game and played extremely well , accumulating 14 points , 13 assists and seven rebounds in the win . DeMarcus Cousins also stepped up in Rondo 's absence , totaling 26 points and 12 rebounds . Rudy Gay and Omri Casspi also chipped in for some great games , as they combined for 36 points , 19 rebounds , nine assists and eight steals in the victory . This was a great team performance from Sacramento and it 's nice to see everyone chipping in without Rondo in the lineup . The Kings have a few days off until their next game , when they take on the struggling Minnesota Timberwolves on Friday .
The San_Antonio Spurs ( 48 - 9 ) defeated the Sacramento Kings ( 24 - 32 ) 108 - 92 at Sleep Train Arena on Wednesday . Tony Parker’s 23 points were good enough to lead all scorers in the contest , and his impressive shot selection made his 11 - of - 17 shooting from the field look easy . Parker added six assists and three rebounds to his all around strong performance , one that flashed his brilliant basketball IQ , especially when finding Danny Green around the perimeter or Kawhi Leonard in transition . Unsurprisingly , the Spurs shared the ball in selfless fashion , as marked by their team 's total of 26 assists . Leonard was originally listed as questionable with a calf injury entering Wednesday morning , but still started and logged 28 minutes of game time , as he contributed 18 points , one assist and seven rebounds in the well rounded performance . The Spurs shot 52 percent from the field as a unit , and had no trouble handling DeMarcus Cousins during the first half , specifically the second quarter , where they held the Kings to only 14 points and entered the half with a double figure lead . The Spurs will play the second game of a back - to - back on the road against the Utah Jazz ( 28 - 28 ) on Thursday . DeMarcus Cousins was both the reason the Kings were out of the game in the first half , and right back in the contest during the second half . Cousins failed to register a basket in his first 10 attempts , and if not for Rajon Rondo’s supreme passing ability , the double figure lead that the Spurs entered the half with could have been much worse . Cousins stormed out in the third quarter , leading his unit to outscore the Spurs by five points in the third quarter alone , but it was not enough for a comeback to be kept within striking distance . The Kentucky big man finished with 22 points and 10 rebounds on 8 - of - 23 shooting . Rondo was given miles of space to shoot the ball , but shied away from the opportunity in favor of finding the open man , even if it meant threading the needle to do so . The league’s best passing point guard upped his leading assists per game statistic after registering 18 dimes , to go along with seven points and eight rebounds . Rudy Gay and Quincy Acy were on the receiving end of many of Rondo’s assists , as both front court players contributed double figures . The Kings will host the Los Angeles Clippers ( 37 - 20 ) on Friday .
The Orlando Magic ( 28 - 36 ) defeated the Sacramento Kings ( 25 - 39 ) 107 - 100 on Friday . There was some serious star power missing in this game , but the Magic prevailed in an impressive performance . The differential in shooting was key , as Orlando shot 52 percent from the field with the Kings shooting just under 40 percent on their end . The rebounding was a huge factor as well , as the Magic recorded 51 rebounds to the Kings 37 . Orlando had to play this game without Nikola Vucevic and Elfrid Payton , but still pulled out a rare road win . Aaron Gordon was the star , as he double - doubled in a 20 - point 11 - rebound performance . While Victor Oladipo and Evan Fournier shot poorly , they still combined for 34 points , 11 rebounds , 11 assists and six steals in the win . The Magic have a quick turnaround , as they play the Portland Trail Blazers on Saturday in their next game . This gives the Kings their eighth loss in their last nine games and they had to play this one without a suspended DeMarcus Cousins . Rajon Rondo ran the team , as he tallied 16 points , 14 assists and five rebounds in the loss . Rudy Gay and Darren Collison really struggled , as they combined to shoot 5 - for - 23 in the defeat . The only other notable line was that of Kosta Koufos , who scored a team - high 19 points off the bench . Cousins should be back for Sacramento 's next game , as they play the Utah Jazz on Sunday .
The Sacramento Kings ( 30 - 45 ) defeated the Washington Wizards ( 36 - 39 ) 120 - 111 at Sleep Train Arena on Wednesday . The Kings took care of business on their home court en route to their 30th win of the season , which marked the first time since 2007 - 2008 , but the a bizarre final 10 seconds of play resulted in a double technical at the expense of Rajon Rondo and DeMarcus Cousins . Following a Wizards bucket , Rondo and Cousins appeared to mock the refs , walking towards their bench both clapping simultaneously . Rondo was then ejected for arguing with the ref , and Cousins earned his 16th technical foul of the season . If all holds up , both players will likely be suspended for their next game . Despite the strange ending , the Kings had little trouble handling their opponent on the second game of a back - to - back for Washington . The first quarter went in favor of the Wizards , and John Wall got them off to a hot start after scoring seven points and adding four rebounds and four assists in that first period . Wall is accustomed to dealing dimes against Sacramento , his season high 19 assists came against the Kings late in December . From there on out Cousins went on to score at will and abuse his matchup with Marcin Gortat . Washington got some life back in them when Otto Porter Jr. went on a scoring run in the third quarter , but poor shot selection in the final period sank their chances of overcoming the deficit . Cousins finished with 29 points , 10 rebounds , four assists and four blocks on 11 - of - 18 shooting in 32 minutes . Rondo completed his 36th double - double of the season with 15 points and 11 assists . The Kings elite duo looked fresh after sitting out against the Trail Blazers on Monday . Rudy Gay either knocked down his midrange jumpers , but failed to convert a three - pointer , as he finished 0 - of - 3 from behind the arc . Gay finished with 15 points and four boards . The Sacramento bench saw three standout double figure performances from Omri Casspi , Kosta Koufos and Darren Collison , with the latter of the trio impressively completing a double - double alongside Rondo with 13 points and 10 assists . Bradley Beal and Porter Jr. aided the Wizards in the scoring department , as John Wall’s jump shot failed him for a second consecutive game . Beal added 24 points , three rebounds and four assists , while also providing a highlight of his handles after taking advantage of the flat footed Willie Cauley-Stein for a pretty crossover . Most of Porter Jr’s 20 points came in the third quarter , but his shooting was efficient after going 8 - of - 11 from the field . The Wizards out - rebounded and out - assisted the Kings , but even after shooting 48 percent from the field , it was not enough to match the Kings lights out 56 percent shooting as a unit . Both teams will suit up on Friday , as the Kings will host the MIami Heat ( 43 - 30 ) , while the Wizards visit the Phoenix Suns ( 20 - 55 ) .
The Sacramento Kings ( 32 - 48 ) defeated the Oklahoma_City Thunder ( 54 - 26 ) 114 - 112 on Saturday . Although their postseason hopes have long been crushed , the Kings took on the third - seeded Thunder as if they had something to play for . Kings coach George Karl opted to give Rajon Rondo another night off to rest , bringing Darren Collison into the starting lineup . The veteran guard responded well to the starting opportunity , tallying the team 's highest point total . The high - scoring , back - and - forth affair came down to the final seconds , as Rudy Gay was able to sink two free throws after a Serge Ibaka foul with less than a second remaining . On the Thunder 's last - gasp possession , Russell Westbrook , who committed a game - high eight turnovers , missed a desperation 52 - foot three - point heave that would have sent the game into overtime . Oklahoma_City was led by Kevin Durant 's 31 points , which he supplemented with eight assists and six rebounds . Westbrook was next with 24 points , 10 assists , five rebounds and a steal . Ibaka managed 14 points , eight rebounds and two steals . Enes Kanter paced the bench with 11 points , six rebounds and a steal . The Thunder remains atop the Western Conference 's Northwest Division , and are in the third seed in the conference as well . They 're home against the Los Angeles Lakers on Monday night . Sacramento was paced by Collison 's 27 points , eight assists , five rebounds and a steal . Gay was next with 24 points , eight rebounds , three assists , four steals and two blocks . DeMarcus Cousins had a quiet night by his standards , supplying 15 points , seven rebounds , three assists , two steals and a block . Seth Curry paced the bench with 20 points , three assists and two rebounds . The Kings are currently in third place in the Western Conference 's Pacific Division . They head to Phoenix to take on the Suns on Monday night .
The New_York Knicks held off the Charlotte Hornets 102 - 94 on Tuesday , thanks to a dominant third quarter . In a game where Charlotte was up by two at half , the Knicks put together a huge 34 - point third quarter to eventually lock up the win . The Knicks dominated the rebounding margin in the first game between these two teams , but they dominated the shooting here . The Hornets actually outshot the Knicks from the field , but the Knicks shot 95 percent from the free - throw line and 50 percent from three - point range . The Hornets shot just 68 percent from the free - throw line and 25 percent from three - point range . New_York also out - assisted Charlotte 22 - 13 and simply looked like the better team on Tuesday . The Hornets prevailed in the first game between these two teams , but just didn’t play well enough to win on Tuesday . The Hornets were led by Kemba Walker , who continues to prove that Madison Square Garden is one of his favorite places to play . Walker tallied 31 points , four rebounds and three steals in the loss . After winning Player of the Week last week , Nicolas Batum started this week with a terrible game . Batum scored just four points on 1 - for - 9 shooting and provided just six rebounds and no other notable statistics , which is a bit strange for a player who regularly stuffs the stat sheet . The bench did play well for the Hornets though , as they had three players record at least 12 points and five rebounds in the defeat . Charlotte will look to bounce - back on Wednesday against the struggling Brooklyn Nets in the second half of a back - to - back for both teams . The Knicks barely held off the Hornets on Tuesday , but their just happy to get the win . They were led by rookie Kristaps Porzingis , who tallied a career - high 29 points and 11 rebounds in the win . Skeptics who were calling this rookie a bust before he played a game are surely eating their words at this point . After being a terrible team last year , the Knicks have some fire this year and much of the success has to go to this talented rookie . New_York was also led by another good performance from Carmelo Anthony , who collected 18 points , 11 rebounds and five assists in the victory . These two are the cornerstones for the franchise at this point and that has to make Knicks fans somewhat encouraged . The Knicks have a few days off until they play the Oklahoma City Thunder on Friday in OKC in their next schedule game .
The Houston Rockets ( 7 - 10 ) defeated the New_York Knicks ( 8 - 10 ) 116 - 111 in overtime on Sunday . The Knicks learned before the game that Carmelo Anthony would miss the contest with an illness , setting the stage for additional offensive responsibility for offseason acquisition Arron Afflalo . The veteran shooting guard resoundingly answered the bell , posting a season - high and game - high 31 points on an outstanding 13 - of - 19 shooting performance . Six of those points came in the extra period , as the Knicks pulled even with the Rockets at 111 before Houston was able to pull away . Afflalo 's effort was part of a remarkable 58 percent shooting night for the Knicks , which notably accomplished the feat in Anthony 's absence . The stellar accuracy rate from the field also was considerably better than the victorious Rockets ' 45 percent figure . Kristaps Porzingis supported Afflalo 's stellar performance with a huge double - double that consisted of 20 points and 13 rebounds , along with an assist , a steal and a pair of blocks . Lance Thomas also turned in a solid game in a spot start in Anthony 's stead , amassing 15 points and three rebounds . However , Jose Calderon ( seven points , five rebounds , four assists and a steal ) and Robin Lopez ( scoreless over 15 minutes , with three rebounds , two assists and a block ) could not do much to support New_York 's offensive cause . Kevin Seraphin paced the Knicks ' bench with a 14 - point , seven - rebound outing , his second consecutive double - digit scoring game . Derrick Williams also represented the reserves well , managing 12 points and four rebounds . The Knicks fell to 8 - 10 and currently reside in third place in the Eastern Conference 's Atlantic Division . They next face the Sixers in a home tilt on Wednesday . Although James Harden once again paced the Rockets ' offense with 26 points , seven rebounds and nine assists , it was clutch three - pointers by Marcus Thornton and Trevor Ariza in the fourth quarter and overtime , respectively , that helped guarantee a hard - fought victory . Thornton led Houston 's bench with 18 points , an assist and a steal , and drained a long - range bucket with 32 seconds left in regulation to knot the score at 101 . Ariza assisted on another Thornton trey in overtime , and then sank his own shot from beyond the arc with 1:12 left in the extra period to close out a 16 - point , seven - rebound night that also included an assist and a pair of steals . Clint Capela put forward another outstanding effort in a spot start in place of Terrence Jones , posting an 18 - point , 11 - rebound double - double , his second consecutive and third in his last four games . Dwight Howard was the fourth Houston starter to tally double - digit scoring , collecting 14 points and hauling in six boards . The Rockets improved to 7 - 10 and currently reside in fourth place in the Western Conference 's Southwest Division . They head to Detroit for a Monday matchup against the Pistons .
The Washington Wizards ( 23 - 27 ) fought off a second - half rally from the New_York Knicks ( 23 - 32 ) to win 111 - 108 at Madison Square Garden on Tuesday . Despite being outscored by 13 in the third quarter , Washington was able to narrowly pull out a win in the game 's final minutes . All-Star point guard John Wall not only led the Wizards in scoring with 28 , but dished out his second - highest assist total of the season with 17 . Wall played a whopping 43 minutes in four quarters and turned the ball over just once despite being the focal point of the Washington offense . Meanwhile , Wall 's backcourt partner in crime Bradley Beal drilled five three - pointers and poured in 26 points overall . Beal shot a disappointing 5 - for - 9 from the free - throw line , but more than made up for it with his impressive shooting from the field ( 8 - of - 14 ) and his stellar defense ( four steals ) . Overall , Washington won with a lights - out shooting performance from beyond the arc , as the team shot 16 - for - 26 from deep . Rebounding , however , proved to be an issue for the Wizards , as they pulled down just 32 boards to New_York 's 46 . Superstar Carmelo Anthony was unsurprisingly the leader for his team on Tuesday , as he posted a game - high 33 points to go along with 13 rebounds . Melo hit three three - pointers and was perfect from the line , helping his team post an impressive 53 percent from the field . Anthony saw help in the form of Latvian rookie Kristaps Porzingis , who scored 20 points and blocked three shots . The Knicks struggled , however , to match their opponents ' heat from beyond the arc , as they shot just 31 percent from three - point territory . The Wizards will see their last contest before the All-Star break on Thursday as they visit Milwaukee . The Knicks , meanwhile , are done until after the break . They resume action in Brooklyn on Feb. 19 .
The Portland Trail_Blazers ( 33 - 28 ) continued their ridiculous hot streak on Tuesday , beating the New_York Knicks ( 25 - 37 ) 104 - 85 at Madison Square Garden . Portland has now won 13 of its last 15 games . Despite most preseason projections placing the Blazers squarely in the lottery , the surprising young team has emerged as the sixth - place team in the Western Conference with a real chance to make it to fifth by the season 's end . Much of the credit for Portland 's meteoric rise must be given to point guard Damian Lillard , of course , whose averages of 30 points and 7 assists per game helped Portland to the league 's second - best record in the month of February . Lillard took the reigns once again on Tuesday , pouring in 30 points including a perfect 10 - for - 10 from the line . Guard C.J. McCollum was also an integral piece , as he exploded for 25 points . McCollum has emerged as one of the league 's biggest breakout stars this season , making Portland one of just two teams in the association with multiple guards averaging over 20 points per game . No other Portland starter notched more than four points , but it did n't seem to matter , as the dynamic duo 's 55 combined points were enough to bury the struggling Knicks . For New_York , poor shooting was the story of the night . The team posted splits of just 38/29/72 in what was a truly abysmal night from the field . While perennial All-Star Carmelo Anthony scored a team - leading 23 points , no other Knick eclipsed 13 on the night , and only four scored in double - digits . Last year 's last - place team is once again beginning to slide towards the bottom of the East , as the Knicks now sit at 12 games below .500 . New_York will attempt to bounce back against the surging Celtics in Boston on Friday . Portland , meanwhile , will be visiting Boston two days earlier for a Wednesday matchup against another red - hot team .
The Sacramento Kings ( 27 - 42 ) picked up a road win Sunday night over the New_York Knicks ( 28 - 43 ) at Madison Square Garden , 88 - 80 . The Knicks ' only lead of the game came at 4 - 2 , as the Kings immediately rattled off a 19 - 4 run to open up a 21 - 8 lead . The Knicks managed the close the lead to three points at halftime , and the Kings never led by double - digits in the second half , but the early lead they built up was enough to hold off New_York 's anemic offense , which was clearly feeling the loss of Carmelo Anthony , who was out with migraines . DeMarcus Cousins scored a game - high 24 points ( 11 - 23 FG ) and grabbed a game - high 20 rebounds ( five offensive ) to lead the Kings , his second 20 - 20 game of the season ( 2/19 against Denver ) . Rudy Gay added 17 points ( 8 - 21 FG ) and Omri Casspi scored 15 points ( 5 - 9 FG ) off the bench . The Kings shot just 28 percent from three ( 7 - 25 ) and 40 percent from the floor , but they committed just 11 turnovers as they played just clean enough to earn the victory . Robin Lopez 's 23 points led the Knicks , and he matched Cousins 's 20 rebounds in his first 20 - 20 game of the season . Kristaps Porzingis was the only other Knicks starter to get into double digits , as he scored 13 on 6 - 17 shooting . Jerami Grant added 14 off the bench ( 6 - 15 FG ) , and Deron Williams scored 11 in 21 minutes of play ( 4 - 9 FG ) . The Knicks shot a brutal 35 percent from the floor and 4 - 19 ( 21 percent ) from the three - point line in the loss . The Kings continue their road trip Monday in Chicago against the Bulls . The Knicks also play the Bulls in their next game , Wednesday in Chicago .
The New_York Knicks ( 30 - 43 ) took down the shorthanded Chicago Bulls ( 36 - 35 ) for the second straight night on Thursday , winning 106 - 94 . Though not mathematically eliminated , the Knicks remain squarely out of the Eastern Conference playoff picture . However , the team has now won two straight after a back - to - back against the ailing Bulls . All-Star Carmelo Anthony led the team with 26 points , also pulling down seven rebounds . Rookie Kristaps Porzingis also had a big night , notching a 19 - point , 10 - rebound double - double . The Latvian big man also swatted three shots en route to the win . The Bulls have been grappling with major injuries for months , and Thursday was no exception . Key players Pau Gasol and Tony Snell both sat , allowing big man Cristiano Felicio to slide into the starting lineup despite his average of just 7 minutes per game on the season . The Bulls recorded a paltry 15 assists on the night , and the Chicago bench combined for just 20 in the contest . Despite these shortcomings , former MVP Derrick Rose did shine with a big 30 - point scoring night . The Bulls now sit 2 games behind the Pistons in the Eastern Conference playoff race . The Knicks will host the Cleveland Cavaliers on Saturday , while the Bulls will travel to Orlando to take on the Magic .
The Los_Angeles Lakers ( 2 - 8 ) beat the Detroit Pistons ( 5 - 5 ) 97 - 85 at the Staples Center on Sunday . Kobe Bryant rounded out the stat sheet and got the Lakers faithful out of their seats after finishing with 17 points , eight rebounds and nine assists on 6 - for - 19 shooting . The 20 - year NBA veteran was far from his vintage form , but added an important 3 - pointer , and free throws down the stretch to help the Lakers close out the game . The Pistons were led by Andre Drummond , who continues to dominate the glass against every team he faces and finished the night with 17 rebounds , to go along with 17 points and three assists on 8 - for - 18 shooting . Kentavious Caldwell-Pope scored 10 points , but struggled from the field after finishing 4 - for - 15 in the losing effort . Spencer Dinwiddie outperformed Caldwell-Pope and Reggie Jackson ( nine points , four rebounds and three assists ) , as he totaled 17 points , two rebounds and four assists on 6 - for - 9 shooting in 23:43 off the bench . Jordan Clarkson matched Bryant’s 17 points and added six rebounds and three assists in 29:14 , outperforming rookie D’Angelo Russell , who continues to see lowly minutes . Russell played 20:54 and scored nine points in addition to five rebounds and two assists on 3 - for - 9 shooting . The No . 2 overall pick in the draft fired six 3 - pointers , but only managed to hit one of them , while the streaky Nick Young provided 13 points off the bench on 4 - for - 6 shooting . The Lakers moved the ball well and tightened up on defense , holding the Pistons to 37 percent shooting . Roy Hibbert was tasked with the difficult assignment of Andre Drummond , but finished with 12 points , seven rebounds and two blocks . The Pistons will host the Cleveland Cavaliers ( 8 - 2 ) on Tuesday , while the Lakers will visit the Phoenix Suns ( 5 - 4 ) on Monday .
The Indiana Pacers ( 11 - 5 ) defeated the Los_Angeles Lakers ( 2 - 14 ) 107 - 103 on Sunday . The Pacers received more than they likely bargained for from a feistly Lakers squad that perhaps played with a bit more fire than usual , following Kobe Bryant 's announcement earlier in the day confirming his retirement at season 's end . The perennial All-Star appropriately generated some late - game excitement with a clutch three - point shot that closed the deficit for the home team to 104 - 103 with 12 seconds left , but Paul George was able to seal the victory for the Pacers by draining three out of four free - throws in the final 10 seconds . It was fitting that George clinched the hard - fought win , considering that he spearheaded Indiana 's offensive attack once again with 39 points , four rebounds , an assist and a pair of steals over 37 minutes . It marked the third consecutive game that the standout forward has been at 33 points or better , including a 40 - point outing . The backcourt duo of George Hill and Monta Ellis also made solid contributions , with both guards posting double - digit scoring performances . Hill amassed 11 points and complemented it with six rebounds , three assists and a pair of steals , while Ellis pitched in 15 points , six assists and a block . After an up - and - down start to his Pacers tenure , Ellis has now posted double - digit scoring in seven of his last eight games . C.J. Miles had a quiet outing by his recent standards , pouring in only nine points , and Ian Mahinmi rounded out the starting five 's contributions with eight points and 10 boards in another solid game . Rodney Stuckey paced the Indiana reserves with 11 points , seven rebounds and a pair of assists . The Pacers improved to 11 - 5 and currently reside in second place in the Eastern Conference 's Central Division . They remain in Los_Angeles to face off with the Clippers on Wednesday . Outside of his brief moment of fourth - quarter glory , Bryant turned in another absolutely forgettable shooting effort . He shot only 20 percent from the field , needing all of 20 shots to reach his final output of 13 points . He also added four rebounds , three assists and a steal . Meanwhile , Bryant 's heir apparent at his old shooting guard spot , Jordan Clarkson , continued his recent strong play with an outstanding 22 - point , 10 - rebound double - double . Julius Randle , another one of the young stars giving Lakers ' brass and fans hope for the future , tallied his third double - double in the last five games with 11 points and 12 rebounds , with all but one of those boards coming on the defensive glass . D'Angelo Russell continued his inconsistent shooting performances , totaling eight points on 4 - of - 11 from the field , and adding seven rebounds and a trio of assists . Roy Hibbert turned in a serviceable effort at the center spot , collecting eight points and hauling in nine boards . Nick Young surprisingly tied Clarkson for the team scoring lead with an unexpected 22 - point night off the bench , following four consecutive games in which he 'd only mustered single - digit point totals . The Lakers fell to 2 - 13 and currently reside in last place in the Western Conference 's Pacific Division . They head to Philadelphia to face the Sixers on Tuesday .
The Los_Angeles Lakers ( 4 - 21 ) defeated the Milwaukee Bucks ( 10 - 16 ) 113 - 95 on Tuesday . After Milwaukee beat the undefeated Golden State Warriors in their most recent game , fans hoped they came out of their slump . Clearly not , as the Lakers handled them here in a blowout win . The Lakers had a 20 - point lead after three quarters and this game was well out of hand before the final buzzer . The rebounding was the big difference , as the Lakers grabbed 52 to Milwaukee 's 38 . The free - throw shooting was a huge disparity as well , as the Lakers hit 21 - of - 25 while the Bucks went just 11 - for - 20 . Milwaukee was coming off one of their biggest wins in team history , but it doesn’t matter much anymore after losing to a four - win Lakers team . They still want 1 - 1 in those two games like everyone expected and that win means almost nothing now . This team continues to play poorly on both ends and there doesn’t seem to be a light at the end of the tunnel . Michael Carter-Williams was the lone bright spot in this game , as he tallied 19 points , five rebounds and five assists off the bench . They did have to play this game without Greg Monroe and that left them with very little post presence . Monroe missed the game due to some knee soreness and his status is up in the air for Milwaukee 's next game against the Los_Angeles Clippers on Wednesday . The Lakers have been struggling mightily all season , but this was a great all - around performance . Seven players scored in double - figures with Kobe Bryant leading the team with 22 points . The bench was espcially good , as youngsters Julius Randle and D'Angelo Russell both played well here . Randle recorded a 14 point - 14 rebound double - double , while Russell amassed 19 points , seven assists and four rebounds . It 's rare to see this Lakers team hit on all cylinders like this , but it 's a good sight for Los_Angeles fans . They 'll look to build off this rare win , when they take in the Houston Rockets on Thursday in their next scheduled game .
The Los_Angeles Lakers ( 8 - 27 ) defeated the Phoenix Suns ( 12 - 25 ) 97 - 77 on Sunday . The Lakers have largely suffered through a miserable 2015 - 16 campaign so far , with Kobe Bryant 's league - wide retirement tour and the positive vibes it 's generated serving as their primary source of pride and optimism . However , Los_Angeles has slowly begun showing signs of life in recent games , with their mix of young and veteran pieces starting to gel . With Sunday 's dominating victory , a game in which they led by as much as 30 at one point , the Lakers have now won a season - high three straight games . It 's their first such streak since last February , and while not a notable winning stretch for most other teams in the NBA , it could certainly be an indicator of a progressively improving squad . Phoenix continues to struggle on offense without Eric Bledsoe , who is out for the season after knee surgery . Backcourt mate Brandon Knight is certainly doing his best to hold down the fort , and led the Suns in scoring Sunday with 25 points and nine assists . It was his second consecutive 20 - point - plus effort , and he 's now put up a robust 62 shot attempts over the last three games , a tangible indicator of the offensive responsibility the five - year pro is shouldering . Unfortunately for both Phoenix and Knight , Bledsoe 's replacement , rookie Devin Booker , was the only other starter who posted double - digit scoring , managing 10 points and adding four rebounds , an assist and a steal . Mirza Teletovic paced the reserves with 16 points , eight rebounds and an assist , his third straight game with double - digit points . Tyson Chandler ( two points ) , Jon Leuer ( four points ) and P.J. Tucker ( five points ) led a parade of underwhelming offensive efforts for the Suns , who also were hampered by a shockingly scoreless outing from T.J. Warren over 21 minutes off the bench . Phoenix fell to 12 - 25 and continues in fourth place in the Westen Conference 's Pacific Division . They head home to face the Charlotte Hornets on Wednesday . The home team was spearheaded by an explosive performance from two - guard Louis Williams , who collected a season - high 30 points and also equaled a season best by hauling in seven rebounds . The veteran drained a season - best six three - pointers as well , managing his best shooting night from long range on the season ( 86 percent ) . Larry Nance , Jr. posted an impressive double - double in support of Williams ' effort , posting 15 points and 14 boards . Roy Hibbert ( 13 points ) and Jordan Clarkson ( 12 points ) were the other starters to also reach double - digit scoring , and the pair also stuffed the stat sheet in other categories . The former added six rebounds , three assists and three blocks , while the latter supplemented his points with seven assists , five rebounds , three steals and a block . Brandon Bass led the Los_Angeles bench with an eight - point outing . The Lakers improved to 8 - 27 but remain in last place in the Western Conference 's Pacific Division . They 'll be home again on Tuesday for a date with the reigning NBA champion Golden State Warriors .
The Oklahoma_City Thunder ( 26 - 11 ) defeated the Los_Angeles Lakers 117 - 113 on Friday night . The prior results from this particular matchup would have indicated a Thunder blowout , but this was one of the most exciting games of the night . In fact , Oklahoma_City won its first two games against the Lakers by a combined 75 points , but couldn’t slow them down here . The Thunder simply made some big plays late that carried them to a win with very little to differentiate the two teams . Both teams shot right around 50 percent from the field and the pace was incredible throughout . Oklahoma_City is one of the three - best rebounding teams in the NBA and that was the difference here , as they recorded 45 boards to the Lakers 34 . The Thunder made this game much closer than expected , but they still ended up with the win . Once again it was Russell Westbrook and Kevin Durant who carried the torch for the Thunder . Westbrook flirted with a triple - double by amassing 36 points , 12 rebounds and seven assists in the win . Durant scored 24 points while snatching down seven rebounds as well . This marks Oklahoma_City 's fourth - straight road win and that 's a great sign with their road struggles earlier in the season . The Thunder will look to keep the good times rolling on Sunday against the Portland Trail Blazers . The Lakers played much better here than most people expected and fans have to be encouraged with the recent play . Lou Williams was just majestic late in this game , as he scored 23 fourth quarter points en route to a career - high 44 points in the game . What was most impressive is that he went 15 - for - 15 from the free - throw line . Kobe Bryant also played very well , as he tallied 19 points , four rebounds and six assists . The bench was yet again a disappointment , as no player scored in double - figures . The best part about this loss was the fight that the Lakers showed , as they played hard throughout and battled against a team who killed them in their first two games . Los_Angeles next game will be on Sunday against the Utah Jazz .
The Los_Angeles Lakers ( 10 - 41 ) defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves ( 14 - 36 ) 119 - 115 on Tuesday night . Los_Angeles carried a 10 - game losing streak into this game , but walked away with a much needed win . Both offenses were extremely efficient , as they both shot over 50 percent from the field . The 66 - point first half marked the highest - scoring first half for the Lakers all season and it set a great precedent , as they carried a 14 - point lead into the half . The Timberwolves shot 58 percent from the field and nearly came back in the second half , but simply got too far down to revive themselves . A key statistic was the turnover differential , as the Wolves committed 15 turnovers to the Lakers nine . The Timberwolves had one of their best offensive performances of the season , but still couldn’t pull out a win . They have now lost 20 games in their last 23 with this defeat . They actually shot well over 55 percent from the field in this game and recorded 36 assists on 46 made buckets , so the defense really let them down . Andrew Wiggins was scorching hot , as he scored 30 points before fouling out in the final seconds . Ricky Rubio had a nice game as well , as he dished out 15 assists to go along with 10 points . Minnesota has a quick turnaround , as they play the Los_Angeles Clippers on Wednesday in their next game . An 11 - game losing streak would have been a franchise record for the Lakers , so there was a bit extra motivation in this matchup . Kobe Bryant was questionable coming in , but he may have had his best game of the season . Not only did he hit a bunch of clutch free - throws late , Bryant finished with a season - high 38 points while also recording five rebounds and five assists in the win . Julius Randle also played well , as he recorded 15 points and 12 rebounds en route to yet another double - double . Up next for the Lakers is a game against the New Orleans Pelicans on Thursday .
The Atlanta Hawks ( 34 - 28 ) defeated the Los_Angeles Lakers ( 12 - 51 ) 106 - 77 on Friday . In what looked like a lopsided matchup on paper , proved to be one on the court . Atlanta used their defense to pull out the win , as they held the Lakers to 77 points on 34 percent shooting . The fastbreak differential was huge as well , with the Hawks getting 27 fastbreak points to the Lakers two . Despite barely clearing 100 points , Atlanta shot 54 percent from the field in the victory . Atlanta has been one of the best defenses in the league over recent weeks and absolutely shut down the Lakers in this game . No Hawks player played particularly well , but they got some great performances from their bench . Dennis Schroeder led the team with 16 points off the bench and Kris Humphries nearly double - doubled in his Atlanta debut . Kyle Korver was extremely efficient , as he scored 15 points , while going 5 - for - 6 from the field . It 's a good thing the starters got a nice rest here , as they play again on Saturday against the Los_Angeles Clippers . Los_Angeles has been playing more competitively recently , but this was a downright ugly performance . They were without Kobe Bryant , Lou Williams and Jordan Clarkson though , so it needs to be taken with a grain of salt . D'Angelo Russell really struggled , as he went 3 - for - 16 from the field after averaging nearly 27 points a game across his last four games . Julius Randle was the only Laker who played well , as he double - doubled in a 16 - point , 10 - rebound game . On deck for the Lakers is a nightmare matchup against the Golden State Warriors on Sunday .
The New_York Knicks ( 28 - 40 ) defeated the Los_Angeles Lakers ( 14 - 53 ) 90 - 87 on Sunday . The game was largely a tale of two halves , with New_York dominating the first two quarters despite missing two starters on offense , and jumping out to a 46 - 35 lead by intermission . However , the Lakers battled back through the final two periods , and the two teams found themselves knotted at 87 with 29 seconds left . Neither club could find a way to break the tie over the ensuing 28 ticks of the clock , with Kobe Bryant failing to hit a 12 - foot jumper for the Lakers after a 19 - second possession . Carmelo Anthony hauled in the defensive rebound off the missed shot , and following a Knicks timeout , Jose Calderon sealed the victory with a clutch 26 - foot three - point jumper with less than a second remaining . Anthony led the way for the Knicks with a 26 - point , 12 - rebound double - double , to which he added four assists and a block . Robin Lopez contributed 16 points , eight boards , two assists and two blocks . Derrick Williams , getting a spot start in place of the sidelined Kristaps Porzingis ( illness ) , filled out the stat sheet with eight points , nine rebounds , an assist , two steals and a block .

The Denver Nuggets ( 31 - 42 ) defeated the Los_Angeles Lakers ( 15 - 57 ) 116 - 105 on Friday . The form of these teams would indicate a result like this , but it happened in strange fashion . The second quarter is when things really changed , as vender outscored Los_Angeles 34 to 15 . The bench was key for the Nuggets , as they got 71 points , 24 rebounds and 18 assists from their five bench players . The Nuggets have been dominant in Los_Angeles over recent years and that continued here . The top - three scorers all came off the bench , with D.J. Augustin leading the team with 20 points and eight assists . Jusuf Nurkic was also great off the bench , as he tallied 18 points , four rebounds and five assists of his own . Nine players scored at least eight points for Denver , so it was a great all - around team effort . On deck for the Nuggets is a matchup with the Los_Angeles Clippers on Sunday . Los_Angeles continues to struggle and the Kobe Bryant tour is coming to an end . Bryant was spectacular in this game though , as he scored a game - high 28 points . Julius Randle was also great , as he recorded his first career triple - double in a 13 - point , 18 - rebound , 10 - assist outing . Jordan Clarkson was the only other notable line , as he scored 20 points . The Lakers will host the Washington Wizards on Sunday in their next game .
The Washington Wizards ( 36 - 37 ) defeated the Los_Angeles Lakers ( 15 - 58 ) 101 - 88 at Staples Center on Sunday . Washington ended a short , but important two game losing skid with an easy victory on the road , and are now 3 games back of the Detroit Pistons for the 8 - seed in the Eastern Conference . The Wizards played at a high speed pace , led by John Wall , who diced through the Lakers defense and took advantage of his matchup with D’Angelo Russell . Wall’s 22 points , 13 assists and five rebounds overshadowed his seven turnovers , which proved to be a non - issue seeing the double digit lead his team held for most of the game . The former No . 1 overall pick ran impressive sets with Marcin Gortat , who was on the receiving end of multiple flashy dimes , and turned in 16 points and 10 rebounds . The Lakers got into early foul trouble and ended up with a total of 26 team fouls , but the Wizards shot a poor 16 - of - 29 from the free throw line . Given the amount of times that Los_Angeles put Washington on the line , the 13 points loss could well have been a 20 - plus point blowout . D’Angelo Russell was no match defending Wall from getting to the rim , but he did equal his opponents scoring with 22 points of his own . Kobe Bryant has a handful of games left in his career , and the wear and tear of his 20th season reared it’s head a few times during the game . Bryant finished with 17 points , one rebound and two assists on 6 - of - 15 shooting , but also looked sloppy handling the ball at times , which he even recognized after checking himself out of the game . The Lakers will visit the Utah Jazz ( 36 - 37 ) on Monday , while the Wizards will head north to take on the Golden State Warriors ( 66 - 7 ) .
Orlando and Los_Angeles played in a tightly contested game consisting of 25 lead changes , and the Magic ended up needing everyone of them . Orlando won the game 101 - 99 after NIkola Vucevic hit a 20 footer as time expired . Vucevic sat out the previous three games with a bone bruise in his right knee . He did n't start the game as the Magic intended on easing him back into action . HIs knee is seemingly doing much better as he ended up playing 26 minutes and putting up 18 points ( 9 - 16 FG ) , five boards , two assists , one block , and one turnover . The Lakers were without Kobe Bryant as they opted to rest him on second half of a double - header . Without him , they spread the ball around , resulting in six players scoring in double figures . Roy Hibert led the way with 15 points , eight rebounds , four assists , and one block in 29 minutes . Los_Angeles will look to improve on their 1 - 7 record when they travel to Dallas Friday . Vucevic was n't the only stellar performer coming from Orlando 's bench . Due to Victor Oladipo forced to leave the game in the first quarter after suffering a concussion , Shabazz Napier played a season high 30 minutes . He led the team with 22 points ( 8 - 16 FG , 5 - 9 3PT , and 1 - 1 FT ) . The Magic welcome the Knicks into Orlando on Saturday .
Orlando defended their home court Wednesday versus Minnesota in a game that needed an extra quarter to determine the winner . After Elfrid Payton of the Magic stepped out of bounds with 6 seconds left in regulation up two points , Andrew Wiggins made them pay by sending it to overtime . However , Orlando held on thanks to Evan Fournier 's triple with three seconds left to seal the deal . The Timberwolves were led by Ricky Rubio , who nearly triple - doubled with eight points , 12 rebounds , 12 assists , and one steal in 34 minutes . It was Rubio 's second game back since missing four games due to a pulled hamstring . Orlando welcomed back Victor Oladipo back who had missed the previous two games due to a concussion . Unlike Rubio , Oladipo struggled mightily with only one point ( 0 - 6 FG , 0 - 2 3PT , 1 - 4 FT ) , three rebounds , two assists , one steal , and one block iin 20 minutes . To go along with the bucket that sent the game into overtime , Wiggins provided 28 points ( 8 - 17 FG , 0 - 1 3PT , 12 - 14 FT ) , five rebounds , one assist , and two blocks in 28 minutes for Minnesota . Rookie sensation , Karl Anthony-Towns , continued the strong start to his rookie campaign with 21 points , 12 boards , and an impressive six blocks in 37 minutes . Zach Lavine and Kevin Martin also chipped in with dobule digits off the beanch with 14 and 12 points a piece . Minnesota will look to bounce back Friday when they welcome the Pistons to Minnesota . His game winning shot gave Evan Fournier a team high 26 points to go along with four rebounds , three assists , three steals , and five triples in 43 minutes . Elfrid Payton also filled up the stat sheet with 24 points , seven rebounds , six dimes , and four steals in 41 minutes . Tobias Harris was the only other Magic player to score in double digits with 12 points to go along with 11 rebounds . Orlando will look to carry their momentum into Saturday 's contest against Sacramento .
The Sacramento Kings ( 5 - 9 ) secured their fourth win in six games in Orlando Saturday night , defeating the Magic ( 6 - 7 ) 97 - 91 . All-NBA center DeMarcus Cousins continued a dominant string of performances , delivering 29 points and 12 rebounds along with a substantial defensive output of three steals and three blocks . The volatile Cousins was suspended for the Kings ' Thursday matchup against the Heat for a forearm punch to Hawks center Al Horford . Aside from that absence , however , Cousins has been on a tear since returning from an injured achilles , posting five double - doubles and logging two 35+ point games . While many predicted a reduced role for Sacramento point guard Rajon Rondo upon the return of backup Darren Collison , coach George Karl instead elected to trot the two guards out alongside one another in Orlando . Rondo , who has been averaging an NBA-leading 10 assists per game , saw a team - high 42 minutes in Orlando . It seems that Karl is committed to keeping the veteran point guard a major part of the Kings ' rotations . The story of the night for the Magic , meanwhile , was inconsistency behind the arc . The team shot just 29 percent from behind the three - point line , including 3 - for - 11 from shooting guard Evan Fournier . Orlando will hope to get back on track as they prepare for a difficult matchup against the conference - leading Cavs in Cleveland . Sacramento , on the other hand , has been picking up steam of late , and will hope to carry this momentum into their matchup against Charlotte on Monday .
The Orlando Magic ( 19 - 13 ) outlasted the Brooklyn Nets ( 9 - 23 ) in a tight one Wednesday night at the Amway Center , 100 - 93 . It all came down to a wild fourth quarter which included three ties and five lead changes . A Tobias Harris layup with 16 seconds to go gave the Magic a 94 - 93 lead they would not relinquish . Nikola Vucevic led the Magic with 20 points on 9 - 18 shooting and added nine rebounds , including five on the offensive glass . The Magic pulled down 17 offensive rebounds as a team , the main reason they managed to escape with the win despite a 44 percent shooting night . Evan Fournier added 17 points and shot 3 - 8 from three - point land . Nets center Brook Lopez finished with game highs in points ( 24 ) and rebounds ( 15 ) as he earned his third consecutive double - double . Began Bogdanovic scored 20 points , but was part of the Nets’ struggles from three - point range , as he shot 1 - 6 from three and the team managed just 3 - 20 ( 15 percent ) . The Nets have won just two of their last 10 and finish a three - game road trip Saturday against Boston . The Magic have now won four of five and will try to stay hot New Year’s Day against the Wizards in Washington .
The Toronto Raptors ( 25 - 15 ) defeated the Orlando Magic ( 20 - 19 ) 106 - 103 in overtime on Thursday afternoon in London . When it was all said and done , the pair of guards who struggled throughout five periods bested the two with the hot hand . In an overtime thriller in London , DeMar DeRozan and Kyle Lowry played as if they 'd left their shots back across the Atlantic , going a combined 9 - for - 39 from the field . Meanwhile , the Magic duo of Victor Oladipo and Evan Fournier caught fire , particularly in the second half , to drain 18 of their 31 field - goal attempts . However , despite a game - high 27 points , Oladipo could n't find the net when he needed it most , missing a 27 - foot three - point jumper with two seconds left that almost certainly would 've given the Magic a 98 - 96 victory . He then subsequently lost the handle on a drive to the basket with 2 seconds left in overtime as he attempted to tie the game at 105 , essentially sealing Orlando 's fate . Lowry did manage to lead the Raptors with 24 points despite the subpar shooting performance , as he was able to drain 12 of 14 attempts from the charity stripe . He also hauled in eight rebounds , dished out seven assists , and tallied a block and a steal . DeRozan contributed a modest 13 points , but was outstanding on the boards , posting a season - high 11 rebounds for his first double - double of the season . Jonas Valanciunas matched DeRozan 's scoring total and added nine boards , two assists , a steal and three blocks , two of which were key stuffs of Nikola Vucevic in the fourth quarter and overtime , respectively . Luis Scola put together a solid contribution of 11 points , two rebounds and three steals , while three Raptors reserves were highly efficient . Corey Joseph led the way with 19 points , four assists , three rebounds and a pair of steals over a robust 36 minutes , while Bismack Biyombo and Patrick Patterson pitched in with a pair of 11 - point outings . The latter 's scoring partly consisted of a trio of three - pointers , which tied him with Scola for the team lead in that category on the afternoon . The Raptors improved to 25 - 15 and remain atop the Eastern Conference 's Atlantic Division . They head back home to take on the Brooklyn Nets on Monday . Oladipo 's 27 points were supplemented by six rebounds , six assists and a pair of steals . Fournier was right on his heels with 21 points , three assists , three rebounds and a steal . Nikola Vucevic posted a 17 - point , 11 - rebound double - double , which he complemented with four assists and three blocks . Tobias Harris nearly matched him point - for - point and board - for - board , tallying 16 on the scoreboard and hauling in 11 off the glass . He also dished out three assists and recorded a steal . Jason Smith was outstanding off the bench in the first half for Orlando with 16 points , but came up empty scoring - wise in the second half and the extra period . He did add five rebounds , four assists and a block . The Magic fell to 20 - 19 and remain in third place in the Eastern Conference 's Southeast Division . They take the long trip back home to face off against the division - leading Atlanta Hawks on Monday .
The Phoenix Suns ( 16 - 46 ) finally earned a win against the Orlando Magic ( 27 - 34 ) on Friday , winning 102 - 84 . Third year center Alex Len led the way for the Suns , who have had a major slide and now hold the third - worst record in the NBA . Len posted 31 points and 15 rebounds in one of his strongest outings of 2015 - 16 . Rookie Devin Booker , meanwhile , followed up a 34 - point outing on Thursday with 14 points , four rebounds , and six assists . The 19 - year - old has established himself as a premier rookie and an elite three - point shooter already , early in his stint in the NBA . The Suns earned their win in emphatic fashion , holding the Magic to just 35 percent from the field and out - rebounding the Magic 57 - 50 . The Magic , meanwhile , remain firmly out of the playoff picture , particularly after losing to the NBA 's coldest team . Sophomore Elfrid Payton led the team with 19 points while dishing 11 dimes . The rising star has been hot and cold lately , but continually shows flashes of star potential . Another prospect , rookie Mario Hezonja followed up a career - high on Wednesday with an efficient 12 points and four rebounds on Friday . The Croatian teenager was selected with the fifth pick in the 2015 draft . The Suns will travel to Memphis on Sunday , while the Magic will take on the league - best Warriors in Oakland on Monday .
The Orlando Magic ( 35 - 46 ) dispatched the Milwaukee Bucks ( 33 - 48 ) Monday night at Amway Center , 107 - 98 . Orlando never trailed as they jumped out to a 13 - point lead within the game 's first seven minutes . Magic center Dewayne Dedmon opened the game with a 60 run on his own and scored 12 points in the frame , after which Orlando owned a 32 - 22 lead . The Bucks trailed by 14 at halftime and although a late run brought it within four points late in the fourth quarter , it was n't enough to close the gap . Former Buck Ersan Ilyasova led Orlando with 22 points as he shot a blistering 10 - 13 from the floor and made both his three - point attempts . Elfrid Payton recorded adouble - double with 11 points and 11 assists , and Mario Hezonja scored 19 points ( 7 - 11 FG , 3 - 6 3PT ) , dished seven assists and swiped five steals . Dedmon finished with 17 points and added eight rebounds , three steals and three blocks . Orlando was outshot by the Bucks , but the Magic notched an absurd 19 steals and turned the ball over just 10 times themselves . Greg Monroe 's 23 points ( 9 - 15 FG , 5 - 6 FT ) for Milwaukee led all scorers . Jabari Parker ( 8 - 17 FG ) and Khris Middleton ( 6 - 11 FG , 5 - 5 FT ) dropped 17 points apiece , and Giannis Antetokounmpo ( 5 - 7 FG ) scored 11 points , grabbed nine rebounds , dished three assists and blocked three shots . Milwaukee shot 53 percent from the field but just 3 - 15 ( 20 percent ) from three - point land and committed fewer assists ( 18 ) than turnovers ( 23 ) . The Magic finish their season Wednesday in Charlotte against the Hornets . The Bucks close it out Wednesday at home against the Pacers .
The Toronto Raptors ( 40 ) defeated the Dallas Mavericks ( 2 - 2 ) 102 - 91 on Tuesday . This was a one - point game going into the final quarter , but the Raptors pulled away by winning the fourth quarter 28 - 18 in a defensive showcase . The biggest differential in the stat line was that the Raptors outscored the Mavericks in the paint 44 - 30 . With the Raptors ' strength being their backcourt , it was not a huge surprise to see the Mavericks struggle to contain Kyle Lowry and DeMar DeRozan in this matchup , as both scored over 20 points in the victory . The Raptors added to one of their best starts in franchise history by limiting Dallas to 38 percent shooting from the field . The Raptors also outrebounded their opponent for a fourth straight game , and look poised to battle for the top spot in the Eastern Conference this season yet again . They have now won their four games by a combined 47 points and have three straight double - digit victories . Toronto , who was powered by double - doubles from Kyle Lowry and Luis Scola , will have a tough task trying to remain undefeated when they complete a back - to - back in Oklahoma City on Wednesday against the Thunder ( 3 - 1 ) . The Mavericks struggled to find their shot in this game , as the Raptors smothered them defensively . Dallas was led by Dirk Nowitzki , who finished with 18 points and seven rebounds in the loss . Forward Chandler Pasrsons played just 14 minutes in this game , as he is still working back to get to full strength after knee surgery in the summer . Now that Parsons , Deron Williams , and Wesley Matthews are all on the floor and healthy , the Mavericks look much more promising than they did a few weeks ago . They 'll look to bounce - back against the Charlotte Hornets ( 1 - 3 ) on Thursday .
The Dallas Mavericks ( 3 - 3 ) defeated the New_Orleans Pelicans ( 0 - 6 ) 107 - 98 on Saturday . Dwight Powell continues to put together strong efforts for the Mavericks off the bench and has become a vital part of Dallas’ big man rotation . Powell tallied 15 points , seven rebounds , an assist , and a block over a highly efficient 26 minutes on the floor . It marked the third consecutive game Powell has posted double - digit scoring , and fourth time in six outings overall this season . Anthony Davis didn’t exactly duplicate his dominant double - double from Friday night ( 43 points , 10 rebounds ) , but did more than his share with 25 points , six rebounds , four assists , a steal and two blocks . However , as has often been the case this season , help from the rest of the starters was hard to come by . Eric Gordon , who’s been the Pelicans’ second most consistent source of scoring , did post his third consecutive performance with at least 20 points , amassing 21 points and chipping in five boards , four assists and a steal . Ryan Anderson turned in one of his typically solid nights off the bench , posting 21 points of his own over 35 minutes . With only fellow reserve Toney Douglas being the only other Pelican to reach double figures ( 11 points ) , New_Orleans remained winless despite having held a 48 - 42 halftime lead . The Pelicans dropped to 0 - 6 and reside in last place in the Western Conference’s Southwest Division . They head home for another tilt with the Mavericks in New_Orleans on Tuesday . In addition to Powell’s solid contributions , several Dallas starters were able to post strong games to help the Mavs overtake and subsequently pull away from the Pelicans in the second half . Veterans Deron Williams ( 19 points ) posted his best scoring night to date in a Mavs uniform , and Dirk Nowitzki ( 18 points ) turned in an admirable performance against Anthony Davis . Wesley Matthews ( 13 points ) also reached a high - water mark in scoring with his new team , rounding out a balanced offensive effort for Dallas . The Mavs improve to 3 - 3 on the season and reside in second place in the Western Conference’s Southwest Division . They now travel to New_Orleans for a Tuesday rematch on the Pelicans’ home court .
The Dallas Mavericks ( 15 - 12 ) beat the Memphis Grizzlies ( 14 - 14 ) 97 - 88 thanks to some stifling second - half defense on Friday . These are two teams that are going in opposite directions right now and this result proves that fact . Dallas outplayed Memphis in nearly every facet , as they outshot , outrebounded and outassisted the Grizzlies . They held Memphis to just 39 points in the second half and 37 percent shooting throughout the game . Memphis has had one of the worst offenses in the NBA this season and that certainly didn’t improve on Friday . They had just 13 assists and made only 30 baskets in a dreadful game . Since moving Zach Randolph to the bench , things have only gotten worse in Memphis and more moves may be on the horizon . Mike Conley led the team with 20 points scored and Marc Gasol put in a 16 - point , eight - rebound effort . The Grizzlies will look to play better on Saturday , when they host the Indiana Pacers . The Mavericks had a spark about them tonight and showed Memphis how tides are changing in the West . There were some fun moments , as Dirk Nowitzki turned back the clock to dunk and record a block in this game . The team recorded an amazing 27 assists on 34 made baskets and that emphasizes how good their ball movement was tonight . Zaza Pachulia had yet another double - double , as he snatched 10 points and 18 rebounds in the win . The most encouraging sign here was the effort by Chandler Parsons , who accumulated 16 points , seven rebounds and seven assists in 31 minutes of play . Dallas will have a few days off until they play the Toronto Raptors on Tuesday in their next fixture .
The Dallas Mavericks ( 20 - 15 ) defeated the Sacramento Kings ( 14 - 21 ) 117 - 116 in double overtime Tuesday . Through three - plus quarters , the stage appeared set for a hard - fought Mavericks victory . Dallas held a 68 - 60 advantage heading into the final period , and was looking to put away a Kings team playing its third game in four nights and coming off a challenging contest versus the high - octane Oklahoma City Thunder on Monday . However , Sacramento crawled its way back on the strength of rousing fourth - quarter performances from Marco Belinelli , Rudy Gay and DeMarcus Cousins to tie the game at 96 with 13 seconds remaining on a Belinelli 23 - foot three - point basket . After Deron Williams sank a jumper with two seconds left in regulation , Dallas appeared to have sealed the win . However , a driving layup by DeMarcus Cousins at the buzzer sent the game into its first extra period . After an initial overtime that saw both teams fail to score after Dirk Nowitzki tied matters up at 104 with 30 seconds remaining , they battled through a second extra period , with the Kings taking a 116 - 109 advantage with 1:20 on the clock . Despite the steep deficit , the home team fought back to score the final eight points , capped off by Wiliams ' own 23 - foot trey at the buzzer to send the Mavs home as weary victors . Sacramento was led by Cousins ' second monster performance in as many nights . He tallied a game - high 35 points , and added 17 rebounds , four assists , six steals and a block . Gay was outstanding in his own right , managing 31 points , five rebounds , an assist and a steal . Darren Collison acquitted himself well in subbing for the injured Rajon Rondo ( back ) , posting a 14 - point , 12 - assist double - double , and supplementing it with four rebounds and a pair of steals . Quincy Acy turned in an efficient performance at power forward , collecting 12 points and six boards . Belinelli made some clutch baskets , and contributed 14 points , nine rebounds and three assists to pace the Kings ' bench . The Kings fell to 14 - 21 and remain in third place in the Western Conference 's Pacific Division . They head home to face the Lakers on Thursday .

Nowitzki pitched in with 23 points , five rebounds and three assists , while Wesley Matthews was sharp from the field , amassing 20 points and adding three rebounds , four assists and two steals . Zaza Pachulia managed only nine points and was the sole Mavs starter that failed to tally double - digit scoring , but he brought down an impressive 17 rebounds and collected five steals . Chandler Parsons had to leave the game after 29 minutes with a hip injury , but managed 10 points and six rebounds during his time on the court . JaVale McGee was outstanding off the bench over just 17 minutes , posting a 13 - point , 11 - rebound double - double . The Mavericks improved to 20 - 15 and remain in second place in the Western Conference 's Southwest Division . They head to New Orleans to face the Pelicans on Wednesday .
The Dallas Mavericks ( 27 - 22 ) took down the struggling Brooklyn Nets ( 12 - 35 ) on Friday , 91 - 79 . The Mavericks have remained solidly in the Western Conference playoff picture despite losing multiple starters to free agency this offseason . Dallas has been boosted by small forward Chandler Parsons ' return from injury . Parsons led the team with 19 points against Brooklyn while also pulling down 10 rebounds . Georgian center Zaza Pachulia , whose campaign for the NBA All-Star game nearly landed him a starting nod , also notched a double - double , recording 16 points and 12 rebounds . The Nets hold the third - worst record in the NBA , and do not hold their own draft pick next year ( Boston received Brooklyn 's unprotected 2016 pick as part of a previous trade ) . Despite these negatives , the team has seen bright play from Brook Lopez and Thaddeus Young in the frontcourt . Lopez led the game with 28 points and grabbed 12 rebounds , while Young posted an 11 - point , 10 - rebound double - double while grabbing five steals . Brooklyn will travel to New Orleans on Saturday to take on the Pelicans . Meanwhile , Dallas will play host to Phoenix on Sunday .
The San_Antonio Spurs ( 42 - 8 ) defeated the Dallas Mavericks ( 28 - 25 ) 116 - 90 on Friday . This game got out of hand early . San_Antonio led 62 - 26 at halftime and dominated in nearly every statistic . Most notably was the shooting , as the Spurs hit 51 percent of their shots , while the Mavericks made 45 percent of theirs . Dallas actually scored 64 points in the second half , so those numbers look much better than they actually were . The turnover differential was huge as well , with San_Antonio nearly doubling them up in that stat at the half . The three - point shooting killed Dallas , as they went 3 - for - 15 with the Spurs going 12 - for - 22 on their end . San_Antonio has had many of these garbage time games and it shows just how powerful this Spurs team is . Kawhi Leonard led the team with 23 points and did that in under 27 minutes of play . LaMarcus Aldridge continued his recent strong play , as he double - doubled in the blowout . The bench scored 58 points in the win and brought eight players off the pine . The rest for the starters was good news , as the Spurs play the second half of a back - to - back on Saturday against the Los Angeles Lakers . Dallas has been competitive in nearly every game this season , but this was not one of those games . The Mavericks bench nearly doubled up the scoring of the starters , as mop - up time started very early . No player on the team scored more than 13 points , with Justin Anderson and Charlie Villanueva tying foe the team - lead . Luckily for Dallas , they play again on Saturday against the Memphis Grizzlies and can forget about this game as soon as possible .
The Dallas Mavericks ( 35 - 35 ) steamrolled the Portland Trailblazers ( 36 - 35 ) in the overtime period on Sunday , leading to a 132 - 120 win . Dallas veteran Dirk Nowitzki led the game with 40 points . It was a new season high for the Dallas legend , whose 40 points led play - by - play commentator Mark Followill to proclaim `` he still is and always will be Dirk Nowitzki . '' The sixth - leading scorer of all time tacked on yet another big performance to a list of many , going 16 - for - 26 from the field with three three - pointers . The team as a whole shot a stunning 55 percent from the field including 15 - for - 25 from three - point territory . In addition to Nowitzki 's vintage performance , point guard Deron Williams boasted an impressive stat line of 31 points and 16 assists . The second unit kept things going for the Mavs , with center Salah Mejri dominating for 13 points , 14 rebounds , and a whopping six blocks . Dallas 's hopes for a higher seed will remain alive after Sunday 's contest , as the team remains in a tight race between the sixth , seventh , and eighth place teams in the West . Portland also saw an impressive performance from a big man , as center Mason Plumlee pulled down a massive 19 rebounds . The young Duke alum was simply unstoppable on the boards , pulling down 10 rebounds on the offensive end alone . The star backcourt of Damian Lillard and C.J. McCollum had a typical strong showing , scoring 26 and 22 respectively . The team had a poor shooting night on the whole , however , going just 40 percent from the floor . The two teams will meet again on Wednesday in what should be an important matchup for the Western Conference playoff picture .
The Brooklyn Nets ( 6 - 15 ) defeated the Houston Rockets ( 10 - 12 ) 110 - 105 on Tuesday . After a roller coaster first 18 games of the season , the Rockets had finally started to build some momentum as of late , coming into Tuesday having won three straight games . However , the recent positive vibes were extinguished in a mistake - laden performance against the Nets . James Harden turned in a particularly disappointing outing , finishing with a season - low 10 points , his fewest since a nine - point effort last February against the Clippers . The All-Star guard also turned the ball over seven times , equaling his second - highest total on the season in that category . Although he was an effective ball distributor Tuesday - - handing out nine assists on the night - - Harden seemed to hurt more than help by not being aggressive offensively , especially after the Rockets lost Trevor Ariza to a bruised lower back in the first quarter . Corey Brewer and Marcus Thornton were the principal beneficiaries of Ariza 's absence , totaling 34 and 26 minutes off the bench , respectively . The former posted a season - high 22 points ( including a season - high four three - pointers ) , along with three rebounds , two assists and three steals . Thornton also managed his best scoring night of the season , amassing 32 points on a season - best 12 field goals and 67 percent shooting from the field . Patrick Beverely and Dwight Howard joined Harden in providing a pair of 10 - point efforts , with the latter coming a rebound short of a double - double . Clint Capela pitched in with a modest six points and nine rebounds . Houston fell to 10 - 12 and currently resides in fourth place in the Western Conference 's Southwest Division . They face the Wizards in Washington in the second game of a back - to - back on Wednesday . The Nets were led by their outstanding frontcourt duo of Brook Lopez and Thaddeus Young , which has often been the case this season , but received strong efforts from their entire starting five . Lopez pitched in with 24 points , eight rebounds , and an impressive five blocks . It was the Nets ' big man 's sixth contest with over 20 points over the last eight games . Meanwhile , Young managed his best night of the year from the field , draining 10 - of - 13 shot attempts ( 77 percent ) to post 20 points . By adding 12 rebounds ( along with five assists ) , the veteran tallied his fifth double - double in the last six games .

The Brooklyn Nets ( 11 - 28 ) defeated the New_York Knicks ( 20 - 21 ) 110 - 104 on Wednesday . The Nets secured their first victory under interim head coach Tony Brown - - and broke a 10 - game home losing streak - - with some uncharacteristic offense that included a late 10 - 2 run . Brooklyn had astoundingly failed to reach 90 points in four straight games coming into Wednesday , and had not even managed to hit the 80 - point mark in three of those contests . Meanwhile , New_York came in sporting a Top 10 - ranked defensive unit in terms of points allowed , but did learn shortly before game time that superstar Carmelo Anthony would sit out with the ankle sprain that had caused him to leave Tuesday 's showdown with the Celtics early . Despite an outstanding performance from Derrick Williams off the bench that helped make up for a large part of the points Anthony took with him to the bench , it was a resurgent Nets squad that got key contributions from a combination of starters and reserves that helped key the win . Williams did lead the visitors with a season - high 31 - point performance , his best outing since he amassed the same total versus the Mavericks back on December 9 , 2013 while a member of the Sacramento Kings . He also added seven rebounds and a pair of steals over 32 action - packed minutes . Arron Afflalo continued his solid stretch of shooting with 18 points on an 8 - for - 16 effort from the field . He also hauled in three rebounds and added two assists . Jose Calderon made it a productive night for the Knicks backcourt with 16 points , seven rebounds , four assists and a pair of steals . The frontcourt was n't bad either , beginning with rookie sensation Kristaps Porzingis , who tallied a 12 - point , 10 - rebound double - double despite only shooting 5 - for - 17 from the field . Robin Lopez also put together a solid game versus his brother Brook , tallying nine points and 12 boards . The Knicks fell to 20 - 21 and are now in third place in the Eastern Conference 's Atlantic Division . They head to Memphis to face off with the Grizzlies on Saturday . Brooklyn 's attack was , as customary , spearheaded by Brook Lopez , who put up 20 points , eight rebounds , five assists , two steals and a block in an inspired performance against his brother , Robin . The most encouraging effort of the night however , may have been that of Thaddeus Young . Mired in a slump over recent games , Young bounced back with an outstanding 19 - point , 11 - rebound double - double that also included a trio of assists and a trio of steals . It was the first double - double over the last five games for Young , who 'd made such performances the norm at one point earlier in the season . Veteran Joe Johnson stuffed the stat sheet with 14 points , seven rebounds , six assists and a steal . Brown also decided to give the starting backcourt of Wayne Ellington and Donald Sloan an opportunity at redemption after a lackluster first game together , and they responded with slightly better production . The former managed 10 points , a pair of rebounds and a pair of assists , while the latter provided eight points , four rebounds , three assists and a steal . However , Sloan was outplayed by the man he usurped for the starting point guard spot , Shane Larkin , as he paced the Nets ' bench with 17 points , five assists and a pair of rebounds over 25 minutes . The Nets improved to 11 - 28 and continue entrenched in fourth place in the Eastern Conference 's Atlantic Division . They remain home for a Friday night match - up against the Portland Trail Blazers .
The Brooklyn Nets ( 12 - 33 ) snapped a six - game losing streak on Sunday with a 116 - 106 win over the Oklahoma_City Thunder ( 33 - 13 ) . The win coincidentally ended a seven - game win streak for OKC . Brooklyn sits at fourteenth in the Eastern Conference , leading only the league - worst Philadelphia 76ers ; however , they were able to come away with a win against one of the association 's stronger teams on Sunday . The Nets have been skidding all season , seeing coach Lionel Hollins fired and GM Billy King tender his resignation . On Sunday , they ended a slough of tough losses , advancing their record to 8 - 17 at home on the season . Star big man Brook Lopez caught fire on Sunday , pouring in a team - high 31 points while pulling down 10 rebounds . OKC defensive anchor Steven Adams sat out Sunday 's contest with an injured right elbow , allowing Lopez to take advantage of the defensive shortcomings of backup Enes Kanter . Lopez was aided , however , by the hustle of power forward Thaddeus Young . The veteran pulled down seven offensive rebounds and 14 boards in total , also notching 14 points , three assists , a block , and a steal . For Oklahoma_City , the loss comes as a bit of a shock considering the tear that the team had found itself on . The Thunder boast the third - best record in the NBA , trailing only the historically good Warriors and Spurs . For Oklahoma_City 's dynamic duo of superstars , Russell Westbrook and Kevin Durant , it was business as usual on Sunday . The two combined for 59 points , 22 rebounds , and 14 assists . Both players were named starters for the Western Conference in this year 's All-Star game earlier this week . However , outside of the superstar tandem , only two Thunder players cracked double - digit scoring , recording 10 points apiece . OKC was edged out at the line and on the glass , as they allowed the Nets to pull down 18 offensive boards and 49 in total . The Thunder will try not to let the loss affect them as they travel to Madison Square Garden on Tuesday to take on the Knicks . The Nets , meanwhile , will play host to the Miami Heat on Tuesday .

It remained tight throughout the fourth quarter , as neither team managed more than a five - point lead at any point in the period , but Detroit 's one - two punch of Andre Drummond and Reggie Jackson proved to be too tough for the Nets . Drummond finished with his third double - double in his past four games as he scored a team - high 21 points and grabbed a game - high 18 rebounds , including seven on the offensive end . Jacksom scored 19 and dished out six assists , and Ersan Ilyasova and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope scored 16 apiece . The Pistons shot poorly ( 43 percent ) but used a ridiculous 19 offensive rebounds to keep their offense from going stagnant . Brook Lopez was ultra - efficient , as he scored a game - high 27 points on 13 - 19 shooting and grabbed five rebounds . Bargnani scored 18 off the bench on 7 - 12 shooting , but Wayne Ellington ( 4 - 11 FG , 3 - 5 3PT ) was the only other Nets player to reach double - digits with 11 . The Nets shot 49 percent from the floor , well above the Pistons ' mark , but thanks to their work on the glass , Detroit took 16 more field goals ( 98 ) than Brooklyn ( 82 ) , and that proved to be the difference in the game .

LeBron James had a very solid outing , with 30 points ( 13 - 16 FG , 1 - 3 3Pt , 3 - 4 FT ) , six rebounds , five assists and one steal , in 35 minutes of action , but it was not enough to get his team over the hump in this one .

The Minnesota Timberwolves ( 20 ) defeated the Denver Nuggets ( 1 - 1 ) 95 - 78 Friday . 2015 top overall pick Karl-Anthony Towns’ coming out party spearheaded the Timberwolves to a rousing victory over one of the more potent offenses in the NBA . The standout rookie posted his second double - double in as many games and was dominant on the defensive glass in particular , hauling in 11 of his 14 boards on that end of the floor . Towns’ deft 59 percent shooting ( 17 - for - 29 ) over his first two career games has also been an eye - opener . The Wolves also enjoyed a nice rebound effort from Andrew Wiggins , who had struggled mightily with his shot in the opener . Wiggins poured in 18 points to supplement Towns’ outstanding effort , and Zach LaVine and Kevin Martin paced Minnesota’s bench with 10 and 14 points , respectively . The Nuggets could not come close to duplicating their shocking road victory over the Rockets in the opener , enduring mediocre shooting nights from their starting five . First-round pick Emmanuel Mudiay paced Denver with 15 points and did cut down his turnovers to a respectable four after being charged with 11 in the opener . However , reserve Will Barton outscored the rest of the Nuggets’ starters with 14 points over 30 minutes , while the normally prolific Danilo Gallinari could only contribute 10 points on a subpar 4 - of - 13 shooting performance . Overall , Denver was only able to muster a mediocre 31 team field goal percentage in the loss .

The Rockets did nothing to assuage the concerns Head Coach Kevin McHale had expressed less than 48 hours ago , failing to reach 100 points for the second consecutive game while suffering a second straight loss . Houston had endured a similar scoring drought over the season 's first three contests before breaking out of their offensive slump by averaging 113 points over the next four outings , all victories . A lack of support for James Harden ( 28 points ) seems to have played a large part in dooming the Rockets ' quest for victory Friday , with backcourt mate Ty Lawson somehow failing to score over 34 minutes on the floor . The Rockets did enjoy a resurgent performance from Terrence Jones , who had himself been shut out over 16 minutes in his return Thursday folowing a five - game absence prompted by a facial laceration . Jones came off the bench Friday to post a highly - efficient 23 - point , seven - rebound , four - block performance over just 21 minutes of court time .

They let the Lakers go on a 23 - 3 run between the second and third quarter and could never recover after that .

Rudy Gay was a distant second with a nevertheless solid 16 points , 10 rebounds , four assists , four steals and three blocks .

The second game of a back - to - back for the Lakers proved to be a heavy workload , as the team looked tired throughout the second half .

Augustin , who rallied the Nuggets after the scoring drought and finished with 26 points , seven rebounds , five assists and one steal on 7 - of - 11 shooting in 23 minutes off of the bench .

The home team largely controlled matters down low , hauling in a collective 51 boards and scoring 42 of their 104 points in the paint , as compared to 28 for the Bulls . Point guard George Hill and reserve forward Lavoy Allen surprisingly spearheaded the Pacers ' rebounding efforts with 10 apiece , and Ian Mahinmi ( 9 ) and Paul George ( 8 ) pitched in with strong board totals as well . Indiana 's frontcourt had been particularly maligned early in the season , but Mahinmi appears to be settling in nicely as the unquestioned starting center , and players like Allen and George have been making consistently strong contributions around the basket as well . Hill could only muster six points to go along with the 10 rebounds , but others picked up the slack scoring - wise . George followed up a 40 - point outburst versus Washington on Tuesday with a 33 - point effort , while C.J. Miles continued his string of strong offensive showings with 16 points . Mahinmi and Monta Ellis rounded out a strong night for Indiana 's starting five with 15 and 14 points , respectively .

The Indiana Pacers ( 16 - 9 ) dealt the Brooklyn Nets ( 7 - 19 ) their fourth straight loss on Friday , winning 104 - 97 . Despite struggles from some of their starters , including star Paul George ( seven turnovers ) and guard Monta Ellis ( 1 - for - 8 shooting , two points ) , the Pacers were able to comfortably defeat Brooklyn for their fourth win in five games . Indiana 's strong showing can be attributed largely to their bench , as sixth man Rodney Stuckey racked up 15 points , while backup big man Jordan Hill recorded a 14 - point , 11 - rebound double - double . The win puts Indiana just one game behind the Cavaliers for the first seed in the Eastern Conference . While Brooklyn got off to a hot start in the month of December , they now face a four - game losing streak and remain the second - worst team in the Eastern Conference .

They will hope to capitalize on a manageable matchup against the aching Timberwolves on Sunday .
The Washington Wizards ( 19 - 19 ) defeated the Indiana Pacers ( 22 - 18 ) 118 - 104 on Friday . The Wizards have already dealt with the loss of an integral component for an extended stretch this season , and that experience is serving them well in the wake of the latest injury to a key cog of their team . Marcin Gortat is dealing with a series of knee complications that includes an infection , and has missed the last three games as a result .

Center Bismack Biyombo recorded a career - high and franchise - record 25 rebounds to lead the team to victory . Needless to say , Toronto was merciless on the glass , outrebounding Indiana 57 - 48 . While Biyombo was the game 's biggest story , shattering his personal rebounding record while also scoring 16 points on just six field goal attempts and recording a pair of blocks , All-Star Kyle Lowry also had a big night .

Guard Monta Ellis came up with four big steals and dished out seven assists , but shot just 3 - for - 11 on the night . The loss puts Indiana more firmly in the seventh slot in the Eastern Conference , and Thursday 's matchup looks as though it may be a playoff preview if seeding remains constant for the rest of the season . Toronto will host the ailing Boston Celtics on Friday , while Indiana will see the powerhouse Oklahoma City Thunder on Saturday .
The Indiana Pacers ( 37 - 33 ) made easy work of the Philadelphia 76ers ( 9 - 62 ) Monday night at Bankers Life Fieldhouse , 91 - 75 . The Philadelphia offense was anemic all night , and after a pair of 18 - point quarters from the 76ers the Pacers entered the half with a robust 47 - 36 lead .

The Atlanta Hawks ( 6 - 1 ) outgunned the New_Orleans Pelicans ( 0 - 6 ) in a high - scoring affair Friday , winning 121 - 115 . The Pelicans led 28 - 26 after one quarter , but could n't keep pace the rest of the way . Although they managed to tie it up in the fourth quarter at one point , it was n't enough , as the Hawks notched their sixth straight win .

The Boston Celtics took care of the New_Orleans Pelicans 111 - 93 on Monday night . The game was tied at 25 - 25 after the first quarter , but it was never close after that . The difference in the game was as simple as shooting , as the Celtics shot 50 percent from the field , while the Pelicans shot just 41 percent . New_Orleans came into this game with more talent and the Celtics came in with better teamwork and it 's clear that the teamwork prevailed here . The New_Orleans starters really killed this team as they were outscored by the Celtics starter 70 - 27 in the loss . Boston continues to surprise fans with their efficient play . They won this game in relatively easy fashion thanks to a great team effort . Isaiah Thomas once again led the team with 22 points and five assists . Jared Sullinger did grab a season - high 20 rebounds in the win and that 's a great sign after his recent struggles . Kelly Olynyk also had a good game off the bench , as he tallied 22 points , three rebounds , three assists , two blocks and two steals in the victory . Boston will have a much better test when they host the Chicago Bulls on Wednesday in their next game . Anthony Davis scored 16 points , but aside from that , the rest of the starting - five was a nightmare on Monday . The other four starters combined for just 11 points and had a terrible plus - minus . Ryan Anderson had another nice game off the bench though , as he collected 18 points and nine rebounds in the loss . This is yet another 110 - plus points allowed and that 's been the issue all season long , as they rank dead - last in points allowed this season . New_Orleans will have a few days off to think about this terrible performance , when they host the Washington Wizards on Friday in their next scheduled game .
After allowing a massive 38 points in the first quarter , the New_Orleans Pelicans ( 14 - 27 ) secured their third victory in four games with a 114 - 99 win over the Minnesota Timberwolves ( 13 - 30 ) . Superstar Anthony Davis dropped in a game - high 35 points , helping propel the Pelicans to victory . Davis has flown under the radar in the Pelicans ' disappointing season , despite his impressive averages of 23 points , 11 rebounds , and 3 blocks per game . `` The Brow '' currently sits at fourth in the league in double - doubles this season , and has been a major part of New Orlean 's increasing success as of late . Point guard Jrue Holiday also exploded off the bench in the win over Minnesota , delivering 19 points and nine assists in 27 minutes of action . The former All-Star has averaged 18 points and 10 assists over his last three games while turning the ball over just four times in total . Minnesota 's season has deteriorated rapidly , as the team has now lost seven straight on the road .

The rookie center tallied 20 points , 13 rebounds , a block and a steal in the loss to the Pelicans .

The New_Orleans Pelicans ( 16 - 27 ) won for the fifth time in six games Saturday with a 116 - 99 victory against the Milwaukee Bucks ( 19 - 27 ) . New_Orleans , last season 's Western Conference eighth seed , has been slowly climbing out of the bottom of the standings since the start of the New Year . The win over Milwaukee puts the Pelicans just three games behind the Sacramento Kings in the conference playoff race . Per usual , the Pels owed a large portion of their success on Saturday to the play of superstar Anthony Davis . The fourth - year power forward failed to repeat his starting All-Star honors this season , but has quietly been averaging a double - double with 23 points per game . Davis 's game was nothing short of the ordinary on Saturday , as he posted 22 points while pulling down seven rebounds , dishing out five assists , and blocking four shots . It was forward Ryan Anderson , however , who led the team in scoring with 23 points while coming off the bench . Anderson converted an impressive 6 of 11 shots from beyond the three - point line . The Bucks are now facing a two - game slide after finally seeing a three - game stretch of good luck . Milwaukee currently sits at last in the central division and thirteenth in the Eastern Conference , just one year after a surprising appearance in the playoffs . The Bucks held advantages in rebounding , field - goal shooting , and free - throw shooting over the Pelicans , but were still blown out in large part due to an 18 - 8 disadvantage in the turnover department . Perimeter defense also posed a problem for the Bucks , as New_Orleans went an impressive 17 for 31 from beyond the arc . Milwaukee will have two days of rest before hosting the Orlando Magic on Tuesday . New_Orleans , meanwhile , will continue their homestand on Monday as they face the Houston Rockets at Smoothie King Center .
The New_Orleans Pelicans ( 18 - 28 ) defeated the Brooklyn Nets ( 12 - 35 ) 105 - 103 on Saturday thanks to Jrue Holiday 's late - second game - winner . This game had an exciting finish with both teams giving blows all the way down to the final whistle . Holiday hit a three - pointer with 10 seconds left to take a three - point lead , but Joe Johnson followed that with a game - tying three with six seconds left for the Nets . On the Pelicans ' next possession , Holiday fumbled the ball before regaining possession and hitting a wild fade away for the winning margin with one second left . The bench scoring was the big difference for New_Orleans , as they got 55 bench points to the Nets 24 . Brooklyn did a great job of hanging around in this game , but just couldn’t prevail late . Brook Lopez carried the Nets , as he tallied 33 points , 10 rebounds , three steals and four blocks in the loss . Thaddeus Young also had a nice game , as he amassed 16 points , eight rebounds and four assists in the defeat . This gave them their 13th loss in their last 15 games and it doesn’t get much easier against the Detroit Pistons on Monday in their next game . This gives New_Orleans seven wins in their last nine games and the “must - win” homestand is really helping this team back into the playoff hunt . Anthony Davis missed the last two games with a concussion , but played big here . While Davis started 0 - for - 9 from the field in the first half , he still finished with 20 points and 16 rebounds in 40 minutes of action . Holiday was great down the stretch , as he finished with 26 points and seven assists . Ryan Anderson also continued his recent hot stretch , as he accumulated 24 points , six rebounds and five assists in the win . Up next for New_Orleans is the Memphis Grizzlies on Monday .
The Los_Angeles Lakers ( 11 - 41 ) defeated the New_Orleans Pelicans ( 18 - 31 ) 99 - 96 on Thursday . Throughout the course of this , his final season , 20 - year - veteran Kobe Bryant has certainly had his ups and downs . He 's gone through long stretches where he 's struggled with his shot , and due to his generally unremarkable numbers , his election to the All-Star team has been derided by some as a somewhat undeserved distinction . However , over the last three contests , Bryant has turned back the clock and resembled the legendary figure that has earned the many accolades he 's received throughout his retirement tour . His remarkable run continued Thursday , with the 37 - year - old registering a team - high 27 points , and adding 12 boards , two assists and two steals in leading Los_Angeles to only their fifth road victory of the season . The output followed a season - high 38 - point outburst against the Timberwolves on Tuesday , and a 23 - point effort in just 23 minutes against the Hornets last Sunday . The steady Jordan Clarkson followed Bryant 's performance with 18 points , five rebounds and two assists of his own . Julius Randle had a tough assignment against Anthony Davis , but did contribute 11 points , eight rebounds and three assists as the only other Lakers starter to post double - digit scoring . D'Angelo Russell stepped in off the bench to pace the reserves with 13 points , three rebounds and three assists , while Nick Young provided 11 points , four rebounds , an assist and a steal . The Lakers remain in last place in the Western Conference 's Pacific Division . They head to San Antonio to take on the Spurs in a Saturday night showdown . Anthony Davis unsurprisingly dominated a vulernable Lakers frontcourt throughout the night , tallying 39 points , 11 rebounds , a steal and a block . Bryce Dejean-Jones , who has been a revelation during Eric Gordon 's absence due to a finger injury , pitched in with 17 points , nine rebounds , an assist and a pair of steals . His contributions were particularly relevant on a night when backcourt mate Norris Cole could only manage two points , two assists and two steals , and during which Davis was the only other starter to post double - digit points . Jrue Holiday was outstanding off the bench , supplying a near double - double in 34 minutes of action with 19 points , nine assists , a steal and a block . However , he missed an opportunity to send the game into overtime when he misfired on a 25 - foot three - point jumper at the buzzer . Ryan Anderson was n't far behind with a productive effort of his own , totaling 17 points and four rebounds . The Pelicans remain in last place in the Western Conference 's Southwest Division . They head to Cleveland to take on the Cavaliers on Saturday night .
The Miami Heat ( 41 - 29 ) took down the ailing New_Orleans Pelicans ( 26 - 43 ) at Smoothie King Center on Tuesday , winning 113 - 99 . It was a big night for Miami 's veteran backcourt , as guards Dwyane Wade and Goran Dragic combined for 46 points . Wade led the team in scoring while also pulling down seven rebounds and committing just one turnover in 31 minutes of played . Dragic , meanwhile , added an impressive eight rebounds and five assists on top of his 21 points . The true star , however , was bench big man Hassan Whiteside , who delivered a massive 24 - point , 14 - rebound double - double while also swatting three shots . Miami has continued to climb in the standings despite the absence of All-Star Chris Bosh . The Heat have ascended to third in the East while their star struggles with recurring blood clots . New_Orleans , meanwhile , has been dealings with injury issues of its own . The struggling Pelicans took a major blow earlier this weak when it was announced that star forward Anthony Davis would miss the remainder of the 2015 - 16 season . A battered Pelicans team took the floor on Tuesday , with Dante Cunningham getting the nod at power forward . It was a tough night all - around , as the team shot just 39 percent . The injured squad did find a leader in point guard Jrue Holiday , who scored 24 points while recording seven assists and four steals . The Heat will go on to visit San Antonio on Wednesday , while New_Orleans will travel to Indiana on Thursday .
The Indiana Pacers ( 1 - 3 ) came away with their first victory of the season in Tuesday’s trip to the Palace of Auburn Hills , knocking off the previously undefeated Detroit Pistons ( 3 - 1 ) , 94 - 82 . The Pacers rode the strength of a 220 run in the second quarter to the win , which came after starting center Ian Mahinmi departed the game with a back injury . The frontcourt reserve trio of Jordan Hill , Myles Turner , and Lavoy Allen covered well for Mahinmi’s absence , combining for 20 points , 16 rebounds , and four blocks over 60 minutes . They weren’t the only contributors off the Indiana bench , which outscored its Detroit counterparts by a 43 - 2 margin . Backup guard Rodney Stuckey led the charge with 23 points against his former team . Paul George chipped in 16 points to go along with seven rebounds , five assists , and two steals . On the Detroit side , taking care of the ball proved to be a major issue . The Pistons finished with 23 turnovers against just 14 assists , with point guard Reggie Jackson ( six turnovers ) the most egregious offender . Andre Drummond also turned the ball over on four occasions , but more than made up for it with a super - size double - double of 25 points ( 12 - for - 17 shooting ) and a career - high 29 rebounds . He’s now averaging a Chamberlain-esque 20 boards over the Pistons’ four games . Indiana will head back home for a matchup with the Boston Celtics on Wednesday , while Detroit gets a two - day break before heading out to Phoenix for a game Friday against the Suns .
The Detroit Pistons ( 11 - 9 ) defeated the Milwaukee Bucks ( 7 - 13 ) 102 - 95 on Friday . The game featured another entertaining showdown between two of the best rebounding centers in the NBA , Greg Monroe and Andre Drummond . Monroe posted a second double - double in two tries against his former Pistons teammates , tallying 14 points and 13 rebounds . However , Drummond responded with 17 points and a massive 23 boards . Despite the Detroit big man 's individual statistical superiority over his former frontcourt mate , Milwaukee easily won the overall battle down low , tallying 50 points in the paint ( compared to Detroit 's 34 ) and outrebounding them 51 to 46 . The Bucks were led by Khris Middleton 's 21 points , and the Milwaukee guard added five rebounds and three assists . O.J. Mayo bounced back from a nightmarish two - point performance Wednesday to total a season - high 13 points , along with five rebounds , four assists and a steal . Giannis Antetokounmpo came within a rebound of a double - double , collecting 12 points and hauling in nine boards . Jerryd Bayless ironically could not muster the same type of production in a start as compared to when he comes off the bench , totaling nine points , five assists and three rebounds . Jabari Parker paced the Bucks ' bench , amassing 10 points and five rebounds . Milwaukee fell to 7 - 13 and remains in last place in the Eastern Conference 's Central Division . They head home for a Saturday showdown with Knicks . In addition to Drummond 's mammoth outing , the Pistons greatly benefited from a pair of 23 - point efforts from Reggie Jackson and Marcus Morris . The former complemented his scoring with five assists , a rebound and a steal , while the latter added to his second consecutive 20 - point performance with four rebounds , three assists and a steal . Veteran forward Ersan Ilyasova , apparently beginning to hit his stride offensively , posted his third consecutive double - digit scoring game ( 13 points ) . Stanley Johnson led the Pistons reserves with 10 points . Detroit improved to 11 - 9 but remains in fourth place in the Eastern Conference 's Central Division . They remain home for a date with the Lakers on Sunday .
The Memphis Grizzlies ( 13 - 10 ) defeated the Detroit Pistons ( 12 - 11 ) Wednesday 93 - 92 at The Palace of Auburn Hills in Detroit . The Pistons thought they had this game won . Up three with 30 seconds remaining and the Grizzlies struggling to score over the final few minutes of the game , a victory was in their grasp . However , with the Grizzlies down just two following Marcus Morris missed jumper with five seconds left , Matt Barnes grabbed the rebound , dribbled the length of the floor and threw up a long 31 - foot three with under two seconds left . Memphis had won . While Barnes ended up being the hero , it was the efforts of Zach Randolph that carries the Grizzlies through the game , as he finished with a monster double - double of 21 points and 16 points in 35 minutes . Marc Gasol added a double - double of his own , finishing with 19 points and 12 rebounds . Mike Conley ( 11 ) and Courtney Lee ( 14 ) were the only other Memphis players to score in double figures . For the Pistons , it was another night and another Andre Drummond double - double , as he finished with 18 points and a game - high 19 rebounds in 37 minutes . Reggie Jackson matched Drummond’s 18 points and dished out seven assists , while Morris scored 16 points . Steven Blake scored a surprising 11 points in just 16 minutes off the bench .

The Detroit Pistons ( 19 - 17 ) defeated the Orlando Magic ( 19 - 16 ) 115 - 89 on Monday night . Despite Detroit winning every quarter , this game was tight until the fourth quarter . The Pistons outscored the Magic 27 - 15 in the final 12 minutes and made the scoreline look far worse than it actually was . Rebounding has been key for the Pistons all season and that won them the game here , as the snatched down 54 boards to the Magic 's 30 . The starters were a key as well , as Detroit 's starters scored 75 points to Orlando 's 47 . That now makes Detroit 12 - 5 at the Palace and they 're becoming one of the best home teams in the NBA . The Magic came into this game with Elfrid Payton injured and it clearly hampered them here . With no other legitimate point guard on the roster , the team had a hard time finding an offensive rhythm in a tough matchup . With that said , Victor Oladipo stepped in as the starting point guard and had one of his best all - around games of the season . He tallied 18 points , seven rebounds , five assists and two steals in the loss . No other starter recorded more than three rebounds or three assists and it was just an ugly performance from Orlando . The Magic will look to bounce back on Wednesday against the Indiana Pacers in their next game . Detroit has been blitzing teams at home all season and they did just that on Monday . What was so great about this win was the performance of Brandon Jennings . This is just Jennings fourth game of the year after suffering a torn Achilles last season and he was spectacular , scoring 17 points and dishing out seven assists in just 18 minutes . It will be interesting to see what Stan Van Gundy does with this rotation with the breakout play of Reggie Jackson and the resurgence of Jennings . All five starters scored in double - figures here , despite having their minutes limited in the blowout . Andre Drummond also put in a 17 - point double - double and would have approached yet another 20 - 20 game if this fixture didn’t get so out of hand late . Detroit 's next game will be on the road on Wednesday against the Boston Celtics .
The Chicago Bulls ( 24 - 16 ) defeated the Detroit Pistons ( 22 - 19 ) 111 - 101 on Monday . Ball movement was the difference in the game , as Chicago recorded 28 assists to the Pistons ' 18 . That obviously leads to better shooting , which can be emphasized by the fact that the Bulls shot 52 percent to the Pistons 44 . Detroit was also horrendous from long distance as they went just 5 - for - 26 in the loss . The Bulls came into this game losing four of their last five and this was a much needed win against some good competition . Pau Gasol carried the team on his back , as he collected 31 points and 12 rebounds in a spectacular game . Derrick Rose and Jimmy Butler combined for 36 points and 13 assists as well . The bench was one of the keys though , as they got 10 assists from Aaron Brooks and nearly doubled up the scoring of the Pistons bench . Up next for Chicago is one of its toughest games of the year , as they host the Golden State Warriors on Wednesday . The Pistons got off to a nice start in this game , but couldn’t get anything going after that . They scored 32 points in the first quarter , but were outscored in every quarter after that . The bench was a huge letdown , as the five players combined for just 18 points and seven rebounds in the loss . All five starters did score in double - figures , but it ' just too difficult to win with the bench doing so little . Andre Drummond was their best player tonight per usual , as he tallied 13 points and 16 rebounds in another great game . Ersan Ilyasova also put in a double - double and he 's been a great surprise for this Detroit team all year . The Pistons will travel to Houston on Wednesday for their next game against the Rockets .
The Cleveland Cavaliers ( 33 - 12 ) took down the Detroit Pistons ( 25 - 22 ) , 114 - 106 , on Friday in the fourth game of the Tyronn Lue era . The conference - leading Cavs have had three big wins in a row after blowout losses to the Golden State Warriors and the Chicago Bulls . Big man Kevin Love proved to be a major factor once again for Cleveland , as he led the team with 29 points . All-Stars Kyrie Irving and LeBron James also saw significant contributions in the points column , posting 28 and 20 respectively . The Cavs ended up winning the game at the free - throw line , where they shot a whopping 27 for 29 , and on the boards , where they held a 47 - 39 rebounding advantage and held league leader Andre Drummond to just eight . The loss snapped a brief two - game streak for the Pistons . The young team has seen a significant improvement over last season , in which they found themselves in the lottery yet again . Center Andre Drummond was named to his first All-Star team on Thursday , and led the team with 20 points against the Cavaliers . Drummond also recorded three blocks on the defensive end , despite an unusually low total on the boards . Shooting guard Kentavious Caldwell-Pope also contributed significantly , dropping in 19 points on the night . Detroit will travel to Toronto on Saturday . Meanwhile , Cleveland will be playing host to the historic San Antonio Spurs .
The Raptors used a second - half rally to avoid an upset , defeating the Pacers 106 - 99 in the season opener Wednesday night in Toronto . After trailing by as many as 16 points in the second quarter , the Raptors outscored the Pacers 35 - 23 in the third . Indiana fought back to tie the game 93 - 93 late in the fourth , but clutch shooting by DeMar DeRozan helped Toronto seal the game . DeRozan finished with a game - high 25 points with six assists and five rebounds . Pacers all - star forward Paul George started the game off slow , but looked like his old self in the second half . He nearly recorded a triple - double with 17 points , 12 rebounds and eight assists over 37 minutes . Indiana 's big offseason acquisition , Monta Ellis , did n't make his presence felt in his Pacers debut . The sharpshooter went 3 - 11 from the field and 0 - 1 from distance , finishing with just nine points and six assists in the loss . The lone bright spot was the three - point shooting of George Hill and C.J. Miles , who combined for 9 - of - 15 shooting from beyond the arc . DeMarre Carroll signed a four - year contract with the Raptors this offseason to provide energy - - and he did just that Wednesday - - scoring 14 points with eight rebounds and four assists while playing shutdown defense for 41 minutes . Center Jonas Valenciunas started off the season with a big double - double with 21 points on 8 - of - 11 shooting and 15 rebounds . The Raptors showed a lot of resilience , hanging on for the victory despite shooting 69 percent from the charity stripe . The Pacers will head home and host the Grizzlies on Thursday , while the Raptors will head to Boston for a showdown with the Celtics on Friday .
The Raptors ( 14 - 9 ) squeezed out a 97 - 94 victory over the Spurs ( 18 - 5 ) at Air Canada Centre on Wednesday . The Raptors held a three - point lead into the final possession following a basket from Kawhi Leonard , but a huge offensive rebound by DeMar DeRozan after a Kyle Lowry miss helped give Toronto the win . The loss for San_Antonio snapped a four - game win streak and Leonard , who was questionable to play due to an illness , finished with just nine points and seven rebounds . It was only a matter of time before the Spurs would crack and perhaps their downfall was due to no one truly stepping up and taking the reins . By the end of the game , 11 players had scored for San_Antonio , but Manu Ginobili led the way with 17 points ( 5 - 11 FG , 1 - 6 3Pt , 6 - 8 FT ) over 25 minutes off the bench . Tim Duncan returned to the lineup after getting the night off Monday against the 76ers , scoring eight points in 20 minutes . The Spurs really struggled from beyond the arc , finishing 7 - of - 26 to a tune of 27 percent in the game . DeRozan not only sealed the win with a big board , but had one of his best offensive performances of the season , scoring a game - high 28 points ( 10 - 15 FG , 8 - 8 FT ) to go along with six assists and four rebounds in 37 minutes . He stuck to what has made him a successful scorer , taking high - percentage shots while working his way to the free throw line consistently . Playing with a short bench with DeMarre Carroll sidelined again , the Raptors got a big boost from Luis Scola , who finished with 16 points ( 8 - 14 FG , 0 - 1 3Pt , 0 - 1 FT ) while pulling down eight rebounds over 33 minutes . The Raptors continue their six - game homestand Friday against the Bucks ; the Spurs head back to San_Antonio for a date with the Lakers .
The Toronto Raptors ( 20 - 13 ) defeated the Washington Wizards ( 14 - 16 ) 94 - 91 on Wednesday . The Wizards have considerably struggled throughout the season defending opposing shooting guards . This surprisingly held true when Bradley Beal , who has a good reputation on the defensive side of the ball , was healthy , and has persisted while he 's been sidelined over the last two - plus weeks with a lower leg problem . The deficiency reared its ugly head again Wednesday against one of the top two - guards in the NBA . DeMar DeRozan led all scorers with 34 points , and added six rebounds , five assists , two steals and two blocks . He drained 17 of those in the first half , a total that partially consisted of a perfect 8 - for - 8 performance at the free - throw line . He preserved the pristine effort from the charity stripe in the second half , finishing 15 - for - 15 for the game . The visitors were led by Otto Porter , Jr. , who tallied 20 points , nine rebounds and a pair of assists , his second straight 20 - point - plus outing . John Wall followed with yet another double - double , managing 19 points and adding 11 assists . He also produced seven rebounds , five steals and a block in a terrific all - around effort . It was Wall 's seventh straight double - double , as he continued his stellar play during Beal 's extended absence . Jared Dudley ( 17 points ) and Marcin Gortat ( 12 points , nine rebounds ) also made solid contributions , while Ramon Sessions was highly efficient in pacing the Wizards bench with 11 points , seven rebounds and four assists . The Wizards dropped to 14 - 16 and remain in last place in the Eastern Conference 's Southeast Division . They will head home to face the Orlando Magic on New Year 's Day . With respect to the Raptors starters , it was essentially DeRozan and not a whole lot else . Kyle Lowry ( 11 point , six assists , three rebounds , two steals ) was the only other front - line player that amassed double - digit scoring , while Terrence Ross and Bismack Biyombo were both outstanding off the bench . Ross collected 14 points and six rebounds while Biyombo produced a double - double in his first game back in a reserve role , tallying 12 points and hauling in 12 boards . The man that he 'd been replacing while he healed from a broken hand , Jonas Valanciunas , posted eight points and nine rebounds . The Raptors improved to 20 - 13 and continue atop the Eastern Conference 's Atlantic Division . They remain home for a New Year 's Day showdown against the Charlotte Hornets .
The Toronto Raptors ( 38 - 18 ) defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves ( 18 - 40 ) 114 - 105 , on Wednesday night at Air Canada Center . The Raptors avoided a second collapse against the Timberwolves this season by clamping down in the fourth quarter . The Timberwolves overcame an 18 - point deficit on February 10th , to defeat the Raptors in Minnesota but the Raptors would not allow a repeat , especially not on their home turf , where their record is now a solid 20 - 6 . This was the Raptors third win in a row and marked a franchise - tying ninth straight home victory for Toronto . The Raptors led by as many as nine in the fourth quarter before Minnesota tied it up at 101 with 3:48 to go . This all too familiar circumstance must have ignited Kyle Lowry and DeMar DeRozan , who went into clutch mode , hitting two three - pointers each , combining for 12 points in the last three and a half minutes . Lowry really helped Toronto get over the hump in this one as he scored 12 of his 21 points ( 6 - 14 FG , 3 - 8 3Pt , 6 - 6 FT ) in the final quarter . Lowry also tallied six assists and three rebounds , in 39 hard fought minutes . DeMar DeRozan poured in a game - high 31 points ( 11 - 19 FG , 2 - 2 3Pt , 7 - 8 FT ) , along with four rebounds , four assists and two steals , in 38 minutes . Cory Joseph finished with 18 points ( 6 - 8 FG , 1 - 2 3Pt , 5 - 8 FT ) , six assists and two rebounds in 22 minutes off the bench . Andrew Wiggins led the Timberwolves with a team - high 26 points ( 9 - 19 FG , 2 - 2 3Pt , 6 - 9 FT ) , along with four rebounds and three assists . He did however give up an unsightly six turnovers , in his 32 minutes on the floor . Ricky Rubio logged a double - double with 12 points and 12 assists , along with three rebounds and two steals , in 36 minutes , while Gorgui Dieng chipped in 21 points ( 8 - 9 FG , 5 - 6 FT ) , eight rebounds , three assists , two blocks and a steal . Dieng played 41 minutes , as he started in place of Kevin Garnett , who sat out with a sore knee . Karl-Anthony Towns , who has averaged 24 points and 13 rebounds in his last six games was relatively quiet , as he finished with 16 points and six rebounds , in 37 minutes . Next , the Timberwolves will visit New Orleans to face - off against the Pelicans on Saturday . The Raptors will host the Cavaliers on Friday , in what will be a showdown between the top two teams in the East .
Despite 50 points from Portland 's Damian Lillard , the Toronto Raptors ( 41 - 19 ) beat the visiting Trail_Blazers ( 33 - 30 ) on Friday , 117 - 115 . Toronto is on pace for the first 50 - win season in the franchise 's history , and currently the team sits at second in the Eastern Conference . The Raptors faced a tough challenge on Friday against one of the NBA 's hottest teams , but came away with the victory nontheless . The Raptors backcourt combined for 66 points , with DeMar DeRozan leading the team with 38 . DeRozan went a ludicrous 24 for 25 from the free - throw line , seemingly drawing every foul en route to the team 's victory . The Blazers also came into the contest equipped with a dynamic backcourt duo , Damian Lillard and C.J. McCollum . The two combined for 74 points on Friday , with 50 coming from point guard Damian Lillard . Lillard , who has been playing on another level since being snubbed from the NBA All-Star game , went 16 - for - 28 from the field and 12 - for - 13 from the free - throw line . Lillard and McCollum were the only Blazers , however , to crack double - digit scoring in Toronto , a stat that has been all too familiar for Portland in their meteoric rise to playoff contention . The Blazers won the first three games of their road trip but have faltered as they hit the Atlantic Division , with back - to - back losses now coming to Boston and Toronto . The Blazers will travel to Detroit on Sunday , while Toronto will host Houston .
The Chicago Bulls ( 33 - 32 ) defeated the Toronto Raptors ( 44 - 21 ) in a potential playoff preview matchup Monday at Air Canada Centre , 109 - 107 . The Bulls took a six - point lead into halftime and led 109 - 92 with 5:47 to play . It looked like they were going to coast to a victory until the final minute , when a Bulls lost ball turnover followed by a five - second violation opened the door for the Raptors , who closed it to 106 - 105 with 20 seconds to go . DeMar DeRozan had a chance to tie it in the game 's final second , but Jimmy Butler blocked the layup attempt and Toronto 's unlikely comeback bid fell just short . Doug McDermott hit four of his five three - point attempts as he came off the bench to lead the Bulls with 29 points ( 9 - 11 FG , 7 - 8 FT ) . E'Twaun Moore ( 8 - 11 FG ) and Nikola Mirotic ( 5 - 12 FG , 3 - 8 3PT , 4 - 4 FT ) led Chicago starters with 17 points apiece , and Taj Gibson notched a double - double with 13 points and 10 rebounds . The Bulls managed to shoot 49 percent from the floor despite missing Derrick Rose ( left abductor strain ) and Mike Dunleavy ( stomach virus ) from the lineup . Kyle Lowry 's 33 points ( 10 - 20 FG , 2 - 5 3PT , 11 - 13 FT ) led all scorers , and he filled up the box score with 11 rebounds , seven assists and three steals . DeRozan scored 27 and added five rebounds . The only other Raptor to reach double figures was Patrick Patterson with 13 , however , as the team as a whole failed to find its shot . They made just 45 percent of their shots from the floor and shot 6 - 20 ( 30 percent ) from beyond the arc . The Bulls continue their road trip Wednesday against the Wizzards . The Raptors head on the road Tuesday to face the Bucks .
The New_York Knicks ( 8 - 6 ) beat the Houston Rockets ( 5 - 9 ) 107 - 102 on Saturday . Coming into the 2015 - 2016 NBA season , Kristaps Porzingis was looked at as a major work in progress , but the result of the No . 4 overall pick has given the Knicks fans something to really cheer for . Porzingis finished the night with 24 points , 14 rebounds and seven block on 8 - of - 12 shooting , including two 3 - pointers and a perfect 6 - of - 6 from the free throw line . Arron Afflalo has made a meaningful impact in his return to the starting lineup over the past few games , helping out from the 3 - point line as well , as he drained four 3 - pointers from deep in the effort . Carmelo Anthony was efficient in his 24 minutes played , scoring 14 points on 5 - of - 10 from the field , including a layup with 0:39 left in the 4th quarter which extended the Knicks lead by three . Six Houston Rockets’ finished in double figures , but it was not enough to win in front of their hometown crowd . James Harden led the way for Houston , finishing with 24 points , seven rebounds and 10 assists on 8 - for - 20 shooting . Harden , who finished second overall in the MVP voting last season , is struggling with efficiency from the floor , shooting 38 percent overall . Trevor Ariza , Terrence Jones , Clint Capela , Jason Terry and Marcus Thornton rounded out the rest of the Rockets in double figures , but the all around effort was not enough to secure a win . Houston recently fired head coach Kevin McHale with interim coach J.B. Bickerstaff . The Rockets defensive efficiency ranks in the lower third of the league , and letting up 107 points to the Knicks will not help that cause going forward . Houston will look to bounce back against the Memphis Grizzlies ( 7 - 7 ) at home on Wednesday , while the Knicks visit the Miami Heat ( 8 - 4 ) on Monday .
In a close contest , the Chicago Bulls ( 38 - 37 ) earned a much - needed 103 - 100 win against the host Houston Rockets ( 37 - 39 ) . With their playoff hopes starting to wane , Chicago will need a solid end to its season in order to achieve postseason berth . Still a game behind their rival Indiana Pacers , the Bulls have spent weeks on the outside of the playoff picture looking in . Thursday 's win may keep the team 's playoff hopes alive , as the squad was able to scrape by against the similarly - situated Rockets . All-Star Jimmy Butler took control for Chicago , racking up 21 points to go with eight rebounds and six assists . Bench big man Nikola Mirotic , meanwhile , exploded for 28 points in what proved to be a valuable contribution to Chicago 's winning effort . Chicago 's stellar 48 percent from the field was a key factor in establishing a lead at the game 's end . Houston , meanwhile , sits just half a game out of playoff contention despite the loss . After making last year 's Western Conference Finals , the Rockets have seen a tremendous drop - off , now sitting below .500 . On Thursday , the backcourt of Patrick Beverly and James Harden combined for 46 points . Beverly also notched seven assists without a single turnover in one of his biggest performances of the season . It was n't enough for the win , however , as the team shot a dismal 40 percent from the field as a whole . With the season entering its final stretch , it will take some winning basketball to get Houston back on track for the playoffs . The Bulls will play the Pistons on Sunday , while the Rockets will take on the Thunder on Monday .
The San_Antonio Spurs ( 4 - 2 ) blew out the Charlotte Hornets ( 2 - 4 ) 114 - 94 on Saturday night . The Spurs were simply fantastic offensively in this matchup , as they shot over 50 percent from the field and accumulated 35 assists as a team . The third quarter was when the tide turned for both teams , as the Spurs scored 42 points in the quarter , which included an 180 run . This was an utter domination in nearly every statistic , as the Spurs had more rebounds , assists , steals , blocks and less turnovers than the Hornets in the win . Point guard Kemba Walker might have had his best game of the season on Saturday for Charlotte and it was all for nothing . He tallied 27 points , four assists and two steals on 11 - of - 15 shooting in under 30 minutes of action . The problem for the Hornets was that the only player who scored more than 13 points was Walker and that simply wo n't get it done against a team like the Spurs . They also shot below 65 percent from the free - throw line and all that makes for a recipe of disaster . Charlotte has a few days off until they play the Minnesota Timberwolves in a very winable game on Tuesday . The Spurs were at top form on Saturday , as they outscored the Hornets by 16 points in the second half . They played some typical Spurs basketball , as they dished out 35 team assists , while shooting 56 percent from the field . San_Antonio was led by Kawhi Leonard who scored a team - high 23 points in the victory . The bench was spectacular as well , as they got 15 points from Patty Mills , 13 points from Manu Ginobili and a near triple - double from David West . The Spurs will look to carry this sparkling form into Monday 's matchup against a struggling Sacramento Kings team .
The San_Antonio Spurs ( 27 - 6 ) defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves ( 11 - 20 ) Monday 101 - 95 at AT & T Center in San_Antonio . The Spurs continued their dominance at home , as they extended their home winning streak to start the season to 18 games , but this one didn’t come easy , as the young and improving Timberwolves put up a fight for 48 minutes . It wasn’t San_Antonio’s most impressive outing , but it was once again their balanced play that led them to victory , as six players scored in double figures . Kawhi Leonard continues to play like an All-Star , as he led the way with a double - double of 17 points and 11 rebounds in 37 minutes . Boba Marjanovic matched Leonard’s 17 , recording as many in just 15 minutes off the bench while shooting 7 - for - 7 from the field . Manu Ginobili ( 13 ) , Tony Parker ( 12 ) , David West ( 11 ) and Patty Mills ( 11 ) round out the six Spurs who scored in double figures . Andrew Wiggins led the way scoring for Minnesota in the losing effort , posting 18 points and six rebounds in 37 minutes , while rookie star Karl-Anthony Towns recorded a double - double of 10 points and 12 boards in 31 minutes . Additionally , while Ricky Rubio struggled shooting from the field ( 2 - of - 9 ) and finished with just seven points , he did manage to dish out 14 assists to just one turnover on the night . Zach LaVine also had a solid outing off the bench , scoring 15 points in 25 minutes . Up next , the Spurs will stay home Wednesday to take on the Suns , while the T’Wolves will return home Wednesday to play the Jazz .
The San_Antonio Spurs ( 29 - 6 ) continued their undefeated streak at home Saturday by beating the Houston Rockets ( 16 - 19 ) , 121 - 103 . The Rockets pulled off the unlikely task of beating the Spurs in their last meeting on Christmas , but this one followed a much more common script . San_Antonio ran away with a dominating victory and really took it to the Rockets . It was a 31 - 7 run in the third quarter that really put some distance between these teams and Houston could never recover after that . San_Antonio killed Houston with their own recipe , by hitting 13 - of - 24 three - pointers en route to the blowout . Houston 's defense has really let them down all year and that was the case yet again here . They allowed the Spurs to shoot over 52 percent from the field and allowed far too many open threes . Most of the starters struggled aside from James Harden and Dwight Howard . The 17 points that Harden scored is extremely low for him , and he really didn’t make any sort of impact in the second half . Howard did record a double - double though , as he collected 22 points and 12 rebounds in the defeat . Houston was expected to lose this game , but the fashion they did it in was ugly yet again and one has to wonder if big changes are coming . The Rockets will look to bounce back on Monday against the Utah Jazz . San_Antonio has been dominating with their defense this season , but the offense carried them tonight . They rank first in every significant defensive statistic , but also rank third in offensive efficiency . They surely added to that efficiency rating here , as they shot over 50 percent from the field and three - point range while dishing out an impressive 31 assists . Boris Diaw was the star of the show off the bench , as he tallied 20 points and eight boards in just 25 minutes of action . Danny Green also hit a season - high six three 's en route to an 18 - point outing with a solid all - around line . San_Antonio has now won 20 - straight home games and they are truly one of the best teams in basketball right now . They 'll play the Milwaukee Bucks on Monday in their next scheduled game .
The San_Antonio Spurs ( 39 - 7 ) throttled the Houston Rockets ( 25 - 23 ) 130 - 99 on Wednesday night . San_Antonio was clearly angry after their 30 - point loss on Monday to the Golden State Warriors and they let out their frustrations on the Rockets here . This was a thorough domination , as they won each of the first three quarters by at least six points and carried a 20 - point lead into half and a 29 - point lead into the fourth quarter . The Spurs shot 56 percent from the field and 52 percent from three - point range in another shooting exhibition . That successful shooting can be credited to the assist margin , as San_Antonio dished out 34 assists to Houston 's 14 . The Rockets were 9 - 3 over their last 12 games , but this is a different animal against the Spurs . Not only did they allow the Spurs to shoot nearly 60 percent from the field , they only made 38 percent of their shots . The only notable line was a 20 - point outing from James Harden , but he still committed five turnovers and only dished out two assists in a down game . Dwight Howard did return here after a three - game absence , as he fell just shy of a double - double in 23 minutes of play . No other player on the roster scored more than 11 points besides those two and the hack - a - Caplea strategy on Clint Capela became a huge issue as well , as he went just 3 - for - 10 from the free - throw line . It doesn’t get much easier in Houston 's next game either , as they take on the Oklahoma City Thunder on the road on Friday . Although the Spurs last loss cracked a 13 - game winning streak , this win extended their home winning streak to an incredible 25 games . What 's most impressive about their home form is that they are defeating teams by nearly 20 points a game on average . Tonight was LaMarcus Aldridge 's night , as he tallied 25 points , 10 rebounds and five assists in the victory . Danny Green and Kawhi Leonard also played well , as they scored 18 points a piece . Even though Tim Duncan didn’t play , the other four starters stepped up by combining for 76 points in just three quarters of action . Up next for San_Antonio is a fantastic game against the Cleveland Cavaliers on Saturday .
The San_Antonio Spurs ( 41 - 8 ) defeated the New_Orleans Pelicans ( 18 - 30 ) 110 - 97 on Wednesday . This win gave the Spurs 36 - straight victories at their home building , which now ranks in the top - six all - time . The Spurs shot lights out in this win , as they went 52 percent from the field , 94 percent from the free - throw line and 60 percent from three - point range . Another key for San_Antonio was the ball movement , as they dished out 30 team assists on 42 made baskets . New_Orleans had to play this game without Tyreke Evans and they really missed his playmaking abilities . The starters accumulated just 56 points with Anthony Davis finishing with half of those . Davis tallied 28 points , 10 rebounds , four assists , four steals and four blocks in a showcase game of all of his talents . The bench was the only thing keeping the Pelicans in the game though , as Ryan Anderson double - doubled and Jrue Holiday scored 20 points off New_Orleans bench . The Pelicans will have a much easier matchup on Thursday in their next game , when they host the Los Angeles Lakers in the second half of a back - to - back set . The Spurs got just 16 points from their highest - scoring bench , but the starters had one of their best games of the year . LaMarcus Aldridge scored 36 points and went 12 - for - 12 from the free - throw line in the win . Kawhi Leonard amassed 26 points and five rebounds , with much of that production coming late . Danny Green and David West also filled - in , as they totaled 30 points and 12 rebounds between the two starters in the victory . San_Antonio 's next game will be against their rival Dallas Mavericks on Friday .
The San_Antonio Spurs ( 43 - 8 ) held off the Los_Angeles Lakers ( 11 - 42 ) for a 106 - 102 win on Saturday .

The Lakers came into this game as a 17 - point underdog , but showed some serious fight in a losing effort . Kobe Bryant continued his hot stretch , as he scored 25 points in the loss . Julius Randle also played well , as he tallied 15 points , 17 rebounds and four assists in the defeat . Jordan Clarkson finished with 21 points , six rebounds and four assists as well . Up next for the Lakers is a matchup against the Indiana Pacers on Monday . The Spurs have a near 20 - point differential in their home building on average this season , but this was easily one of their toughest games of the year at home . LaMarcus Aldridge once again carried the load , as he scored 26 points and grabbed nine rebounds in the win . Kawhi Leonard also had a good game , as he accumulated 20 points , 13 rebounds and three assists in the victory . This win now gives the Spurs 37 - straight wins at the AT & T Center , with 28 of those coming this season . San_Antonio wo n't be in action again until Tuesday , when they play the Miami Heat on the road .
The San_Antonio Spurs ( 53 - 9 ) defeated the Sacramento Kings ( 25 - 36 ) 104 - 94 at AT & T Center on Saturday . It was mostly smooth sailing for the host Spurs , as they improved their impeccable home record on the season to 300 . If not for the Golden State Warriors remarkable run at history , there would be more focus on how Gregg Popovich 's squad . San_Antonio was led by Kawhi Leonard , who scored 25 points on 24 shots , but rounded out the box score with 13 rebounds and six assists . Manu Ginobli proved to be the needed scoring asset off the bench , and turned back the clock with some vintage euro steps , as he scored 22 points on a lights out 8 - of - 11 shooting . Boris Diaw and David West each pitched in double figures , and the well rounded team needed all the help they could get , as LaMarcus Aldridge ( hamstring ) and Tim Duncan ( rest ) did not play . The Spurs depth is one of their biggest strengths , and proved too much to handle for the Kings , who failed to pull the game within striking distance after the second quarter . The Spurs will visit the Indiana Pacers ( 33 - 30 ) on Monday . Rebounding proved to be the Kings major shortcoming in the game , as the Spurs dominated the glass 46 - 33 . DeMarcus Cousins put forth another dominant effort and contributed 31 points to lead all scorers , to go along with nine rebounds and three assists on 10 - of - 20 shooting . Quincy Acy was a go - to in the Kings gameplan , and his 16 points were above his season average , but when Rudy Gay does not get his shot going , especially in a volume effort , the lack of scoring options tends to make Sacramento 's battles an uphill task . Darren Collison added 12 points off the bench , in addition to three rebounds and seven assists on 5 - of - 9 shooting in 33 minutes . The Kings will visit the New Orleans Pelicans ( 23 - 38 ) on Monday .

Behind three 20 - point scorers , the Phoenix Suns ( 10 - 13 ) defeated the Orlando Magic ( 12 - 10 ) 107 - 104 Wednesday night at the Talking Stick Resort Arena . Despite trailing by 10 points with 4:18 to go in the game , the Magic roared back to tie it at 12 - 102 with 2:15 to go , fueld by seven quick points from Tobias Harris .

Alex Len knocked down 20 points on a clean 7 - 10 shooting night , blocked three shots , and notched a double - double with 14 rebounds . Mirza Teletovic knocked down four of his eight three - pointers on what was an otherwise dreadful deep shooting night for the Suns ( 6 - 24 , 25 percent as a team on three - point shots ) , but their efficiency inside ( 35 - 56 , 63 percent ) was too tough for Orlando . Nikola Vucevic ( 8 - 16 shooting ) led the Magic with 21 points and 11 rebounds , and Elfrid Payton notched his own double - double with 12 points and 10 assists . It was a solid offensive night for Orlando , as they rained down 12 three - pointers on 25 attempts , but their inability to stop Phoenix inside - - the Suns retrieved 11 offensive rebounds - - finished them . Orlando will try to get back to winning ways Friday at home against Cleveland . Phoenix next faces the Trail Blazers at home Friday night .
The Brooklyn Nets ( 16 - 42 ) defeated the host Phoenix Suns ( 14 - 44 ) 116 - 106 , Thursday night at Talking Stick Resort Arena . The Suns and the Nets represent two of the worst records in the NBA this season . With this result Phoenix suffered its 13th straight loss , tying a franchise - high . This loss also marked a franchise - high eighth - straight home loss for the Suns . Although they are far out of the playoff race , the Nets have been playing slightly better as of late , winning four of their last eight games , after a horrible stretch during which they lost 15 of 17 . The Nets waived Joe Johnson early on Thursday , which gave some of their younger players a chance to showcase their skills in this contest and they did just that . Bojan Bogdanovic recorded a career - high 24 points ( 8 - 16 FG , 3 - 9 3Pt , 5 - 5 FT ) , in 38 minutes , while Markel Brown chipped in 16 points ( 4 - 7 FG , 2 - 2 3Pt , 6 - 8 FT ) , along with three rebounds , one assist and one steal , in 24 minutes off the bench .

Despite giving up 18 turnovers , the Nets played well offensively , shooting 49 percent from the field , 44 percent from long range and hitting 34 - of - 42 free throws . Phoenix did not do a good job of controlling the ball and establishing rhythm as they gave up 21 turnovers and recorded only 16 assists on 42 made field goals . Mirza Teletovic stood out as a bright spot for the Suns , as he tallied 30 points ( 12 - 23 FG , 5 - 13 3Pt , 1 - 1 FT ) , along with 11 rebounds , in 30 minutes off the bench . Tyson Chandler recorded 12 points ( 5 - 9 FG , 2 - 4 FT ) , 11 rebounds , two steals , one assist and one block , in 33 minutes , after missing two games with a sore shoulder . Alex Len chipped in 13 points ( 5 - 10 FG , 3 - 7 FT ) and six rebounds , in 17 minutes . Len 's status for this game was in question after he twisted his ankle in practice on Wednesday . The Suns battled back after entering the fourth down - 19 , to bring it as close as 10 , a difference their 13 missed free throws would have more than settled . The Suns will host the Grizzlies on Saturday , and will look to avoid setting a single - season , franchise - high 14th straight loss . The Nets will move on to Utah to play the Jazz on Saturday , in what will be their third game of a nine - game road trip .

The Grizzlies are banged up , but they are still finding ways to pull out tough victories and hold on to the 5 - seed in the Western Conference . The Suns would normally be an easy matchup for the physical Memphis style of play , but it took the backcourt some time to get warm before eventually closing out the game late in the fourth quarter . Phoenix was ahead for most of the first half , and extended a lead into double figures midway through the second quarter , however , they were unable to hold onto their lead with the game tied with under one minute remaining in regulation . Lance Stephenson put back a missed layup to take a two point lead , and the Grizzlies did the rest of their damage from the free throw line to close out . The Grizzlies recently signed Jordan Farmar to a 10 day contract , and the signing looked to be a positive one after Farmar saw 22 minutes off the bench and added 12 points on 4 - of - 8 shooting , including two clutch free throws down the stretch . Ray McCallum continues to see starting minutes , and although his shot selection was iffy ( nine points on 3 - of - 10 shooting ) , he did complete seven assists and add two steals . Zach Randolph has become the go - to scorer for Memphis , and continued to be a monster on the glass , as he finished with 14 points and 13 rebounds . The aforementioned Stephenson led all Grizzlies scorers with 16 points . The Suns are amongst the bottom four teams in the league and will towards a lottery pick in the draft , but they played a spirited game , one which they were in control to win up until the final two minutes of play . Devin Booker and Brandon Knight continued their volume shooting , but they were far from efficient , as they combined for 31 points on 9 - of - 30 shooting . Turnovers proved to be the difference maker in the fourth quarter , where the Suns added two miscues in crunch time . Phoenix suffered another setback after Tyson Chandler ( back ) left Monday’s game with back spasms after logging two points and one rebound in 13 minutes of action . Both teams face the Los Angeles Lakers ( 14 - 55 ) next , as the Grizzlies visit Staples Center on Tuesday , while the Suns host Kobe Bryant and company on Wednesday .

Tyson Chandler was unable to take the floor with his back injury , but D'Angelo Russell shook off the effects of a bruised shin to suit up for the Lakers .

He also added a steal and a block . Meanwhile , Russell was able to play 31 minutes , but struggled with his shot . The 2015 first - rounder tallied 14 points on 6 - for - 18 shooting , and was only able to drain one of his four three - point attempts .

The Phoenix Suns ( 23 - 59 ) defeated the Los_Angeles Clippers ( 53 - 29 ) 114 - 105 at Talking Stick Arena on Wednesday . The Clippers strategically rested Blake Griffin , Chris Paul and DeAndre Jordan , as their playoff seeding is locked in and neither a win or loss would have changed that outcome . The Suns , on the other hand , were looking to close out the season with a win for the hometown fans , and also had little draft positioning to worry about . Seven Suns players finished in double figures , but it was yet another strong performance from Mirza Teletovic , who finished with 22 points to lead the team in scoring alongside nine rebounds and two assists .

Jeff Greene and CJ Wilcox were the leaders off the bench for the Clippers , and combined for 38 points on 15 - of - 29 shooting . Pablo Prigioni and Austin Rivers started in the backcourt and the additional minutes will likely aid the Clippers as they head into the playoffs with the 4 - seed . Both players eclipsed 30 minutes of action , but played a rather slow paced game on their way to 24 combined points . The Clippers will meet the Portland Trail Blazers in the first round of the Western Conference playoffs , while the Suns will look to rebuild in the offseason .

Oklahoma_City scored eight unanswered points and held the Jazz to just two points in the extra five minutes .

Denver actually had five players score at least 15 points , but had no player dish out more than five assists . Will Barton had another nice game off the bench as well , as he tallied 19 points , five rebounds and five assists in the defeat .

Oklahoma_City is one of the best rebounding teams in the NBA and that was the difference here , as the Thunder pulled down 54 boards to the Mavericks ' 41 .

Barea carried the load in the loss , as he finished with 18 points and six assists . The candidate for surprise line of the night was Salah Mejri , who tallied 17 points and nine rebounds , which both surpassed his season totals in those statistics .

Minnesota finished the game with 15 assists and 12 turnovers , while Oklahoma_City finished with 31 assists and six turnovers . The Timberwolves were one of the surprise stories of the NBA in the first two weeks of the season , but they 've fallen back into lottery obscurity since . After starting the season 4 - 2 , they are now 8 - 27 over their last 35 games . The crazy thing about it is that they continue to start players like Kevin Garnett and Tayshaun Prince with some talented youngsters sitting on the bench . It was their most prized youngster who played well here , as Andrew Wiggins finished the game with 25 points in a solid performance . No other player scored more than 15 points in the loss and it was simply an ugly performance from the Wolves . Minnesota has a good chance at a win in their next game though , when they host the struggling Phoenix Suns on Sunday . The Thunder have beaten the Timberwolves in nearly every game since their move from Seattle to Oklahoma_City and the dominance continued here . After being ejected with zero points in his last game , Russell Westbrook bounced back nicely here with his fourth triple - double of the season . The amazing thing is that he did that in just 27 minutes of action . Kevin Durant was no slouch tonight either though , as he finished with 21 points , six rebounds and seven assists in the victory .

Rookie Karl-Anthony Towns has started off his NBA career on the right foot , but took a small step back against Portland on Monday .

Minnesota played this game without Ricky Rubio ( knee ) and Andrew Wiggins ( knee ) and it clearly hampered them in the loss . They did out - rebound the Wolves 48 - 34 , but simply couldn’t pull out the win with this depleted roster . The late scratches did open the door for some players though and the Wolves have to be encouraged with some of the performances . Zach LaVine got the start for Rubio and tallied 20 points , eight assists and five rebounds in the loss .

The Los_Angeles Clippers ( 47 - 27 ) defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves ( 35 - 50 ) 99 - 79 on Wednesday . This game looked lopsided in the first quarter and it didn’t get much better after that .

Though the New_Orleans Pelicans ( 0 - 2 ) made a late fourth quarter push to come back from a 30 - point deficit , they ultimately fell short Wednesday against the Trail_Blazers , losing to the home team by a 112 - 94 count . Despite having starting point guard Jrue Holiday back for Wednesday’s game after he rested during Tuesday’s loss to the Golden State Warriors , the Pelicans still quickly found themselves in an immediate hole . They trailed 43 - 18 after one quarter , and 70 - 43 at the half , while looking about as inept as possible on both ends of the court . Much of the team’s struggles were a byproduct of their mounting injury list , which again forced Anthony Davis to see heightened defensive attention . He would rebound from a slow start to finish with 25 points in 40 minutes , to go along with 10 rebounds , and a pair of blocks and steals . Of course , the Trail_Blazers had a hand in the Pelicans’ demise , and New_Orleans’ chief source of anguish was C.J. McCollum . After Stephen Curry lit the Pelicans up for 24 points in the first quarter of Tuesday’s game , McCollum responded with a 22 - point effort in the first quarter . He would finish the night with a career - high 37 points , while Damian Lillard chipped in with 21 points and 11 assists . The Blazers will play their second game of the season in Phoenix on Friday , while the Pelicans will head back to New_Orleans for a rematch Saturday with the Warriors .

The Nuggets defense struggled yet again , as Portland shot nearly 50 percent from the field . The game was close throughout , but Portland continued to keep a distance from Denver and simply held them off til the final whistle . Denver is in the midst of a terrible slump right now , as this loss marks their seventh in their last eight games . It 's not just the defense that has slowed this team down , as both ends of the floor are a struggle right now .

Will Barton played his homecoming game here and performed spectacularly , tallying 31 points , five rebounds and four assists in the defeat . Gary Harris also played well , as he scored 19 points and grabbed four rebounds .

The Nuggets wo n't play again until Saturday when they take on the Golden State Warriors in a game where they 'll surely be huge underdogs . The Blazers have been playing without Damian Lillard recently and playing well . He is unarguably the star of the team , but C.J. McCollum is doing a heck of a job controlling the offense in his absence . He had yet another great game here , as he contributed 29 points , three rebounds and four assists in the win . Allen Crabbe also had one of his best games of the season , as he scored 20 points and grabbed five boards .

McCollum rounded out the backcourt with 16 points , four assists and two rebounds . Turnovers were an issue for the guard rotation throughout the effort , and the Grizzlies slow , physical game plan took advantage of the 22 mistakes Portland committed . Lillard was responsible for seven of the turnovers , but the Blazers are aware of the hindering foot injury and it should not be long before he returns to his elite level of play . Al-Farouq Aminu converted a double - double to lead the frontcourt , adding 15 points and 14 rebounds . Aminu’s career high 11 points per game and 7 rebounds per game are proving to be a strong signing for Portland . The Trail_Blazers will host the Los Angeles Clippers ( 22 - 13 ) on Wednesday . Memphis is coming off a tough overtime loss to the Utah Jazz on Saturday , where point guard Mike Conley ( back ) played 41 minutes on a sore back . The day off was spent traveling , but the Grizzlies staple is their tough , physical style of play . The Blazers never came within striking distance and that came on the shoulders of Zach Randolph , who added 26 points and 18 rebounds in 31 minutes off the bench . Jeff Green and Matt Barnes started at the forward positions , but struggled to aid the scoring sheet after combining to go 3 - for - 17 from the field . Conley contributed nine points , four assists and two rebounds , while not allowing a turnover , in 26 minutes . The Grizzlies managed the clock well , took care of the basketball and won the rebounding battle ( 52 - 42 ) to spoil Lillards return and come away with a road win .

The Portland Trail_Blazers ( 35 - 32 ) defeated the Orlando Magic ( 28 - 37 ) 121 - 84 at Moda Center on Saturday . The Blazers won by the definition of team effort and the scoring outburst from their bench . Granted , the Magic were thin in terms of talent , as Elfrid Payton ( elbow ) , Brandon Jennings ( achilles ) and Nikola Vucevic ( groin ) were all out for the game . Portland dominated every quarter of play and went into the half with a 21 point lead , and the efficient shooting as a whole kept Orlando out of striking distance throughout the final two quarters . The Blazers were led by Damian Lillard , who fell below scoring average , which is good for fifth in the league this year , but still turned in 19 points , 10 assists and four rebounds on 6 - of - 11 shooting . C.J. McCollum added 18 points on 8 - of - 17 shooting , to go along with three assists and one board . The starters kept the Magic at bay , but the bench added fuel to the fire in turning this game into a blowout . Gerald Henderson , Allen Crabbe and Meyers Leonard each played 20 - plus minutes , and combined 42 points on 15 - of - 23 shooting . Dewayne Dedmon and C.J. Watson started alongside Evan Fournier , Aaron Gordon and Victor Oladipo , but their lowly five combined points showed how thin the Magic are as a unit . Oladipo led Orlando in scoring , as he contributed 18 points , one assist and one rebound , while Gordon totaled 17 points , three dimes and four boards . The Blazers will visit the Oklahoma City Thunder ( 44 - 23 ) on Monday , while the Magic host the Denver Nuggets ( 27 - 38 ) on Tuesday .
The Portland Trail_Blazers ( 39 - 36 ) defeated the Sacramento Kings ( 29 - 45 ) 105 - 93 at Moda Center on Monday . The high scoring first quarter fell by the wayside in favor of the Blazers , as their ridiculously hot three point shooting kept the Kings at a major distance . Portland continues to exceed expectations in the Western Conference , and they currently hold the 6 - seed for the playoff picture , with the 5 - seed within reach . As a unit , the Blazer shot 14 - of - 29 from behind the arc and moved the ball around the perimeter in supreme fashion , as they assisted each other 25 times .

McCollum combined for 29 points , 12 assists and three rebounds , Al Farouq Aminu added 14 points and eight boards . Once the starters handled business through the first three quarters , the Kings were able to take advantage of a merry go - round bench in the fourth quarter , but even Portland’s lowly 14 fourth quarter points were enough to hold off any kind of comeback . Sacramento has all but fallen by the wayside in the Western Conference , and given a night where pretty much every Kings starter did not play , Seth Curry rose above the rest to have a solid performance in his third consecutive start . Curry scored a career - high 21 points , to go along with four rebounds , one assists and two steals in 34 minutes of action . The younger brother of the reigning MVP even flashed his range , as he went 3 - of - 6 from behind the arc . Most of the starters saw 30 - plus minutes of action , and the Kings only went eight players deep , but all five starters finished in double figures . The Blazers defense proved too much too handle , which made sense given the firepower that coach Terry Stotts had at his disposal without having to face DeMarcus Cousins or Rajon Rondo . The Kings will welcome the Washington Wizards ( 36 - 37 ) on Wednesday , while the Blazers will look to catch the Memphis Grizzlies in the playoff race when they host the Boston Celtics ( 43 - 30 ) on Thursday .

The Blazers point guard finished with 21 points , three rebounds and five assists on 8 - of - 17 shooting . Lillard’s backcourt partner , C.J. McCollum , who has been instrumental in the Blazers eclipsing 40 wins this season , aided the scoring department with 17 points , in addition to three rebounds and five assists . Portland got off to a slow start and trailed the Nuggets at the end of the first quarter , but they quickly rallied in the second quarter to take a lead into halftime and did not look back . Emmanuel Mudiay closed out his first season in the NBA with an impressive 25 point scoring performance , which led the game . Mudiay added four rebounds and six assists , but played with patience throughout the game and only turned the ball over four times , which he has improved upon as the season went on . Nikola Jokic added 18 points and 13 rebounds , while Kenneth Faried contributed 12 points , eight rebounds and two blocks in just under 20 minutes off the bench . The Nuggets out - rebounded and out - assisted the Blazers , but they were unable to hit needed free throws throughout the game , which became the difference maker down the stretch . The Blazers prepare to take on the Los Angeles Clippers in the Western Conference playoffs , while the Nuggets will look towards the offseason .
The Golden_State Warriors ( 120 ) defeated the Toronto Raptors ( 7 - 5 ) 115 - 110 on Tuesday . In a matchup of two of the best defenses in basketball , this was a high - scoring game . What may have ultimately killed the Raptors was a nine - minute stretch in the fourth quarter where they failed to make a basket . That stat is a bit flukey though , considering the Raptors got to the free - throw line time after time in the final 12 minutes . This Toronto team has struggled with assists all season long and that may have been the difference here , as the Warriors out - assisted the Raptors 31 - 18 . The win makes the Warriors the 17th team in NBA history to start 120 to start a season . The Warriors were once again led by Steph Curry , who tallied 37 points and nine assists in the win . He did however commit a season - high seven turnovers , but that 's a sign of him being more aggressive and getting that assist total up after its been down all year . The Warriors also got a 19 - point first half from Klay Thompson , but he failed to score a point in the second half . Golden_State shot an impressive 54 percent from the field , but did commit 20 turnovers in the win . It was n't the Warriors cleanest performance , but a win is a win . They 'll look to stay undefeated when they play the Los Angeles Clippers on Thursday in a big rivalry game . The Raptors left it all on the floor against the defending champs , but just couldn’t pull it out late . Ten of Toronto 's 22 fourth quarter points came from the free - throw line and they simply didn’t make enough shots down the stretch to get the win in this game . They were once again led by their guards though , as DeMar DeRozan , Kyle Lowry and Cory Joseph all had nice games . The three actually combined for 69 points , 16 rebounds , 15 assists and four steals in the loss . Toronto also got six steals from DeMarre Carroll , who continued to read Steph Curry 's passes all evening long . The Raptors have now lost five of their last seven games with the only two wins coming against the Philadelphia 76ers and New Orleans Pelicans , who have a combined 1 - 21 record . They 'll have a tough task on Wednesday , as they have to travel to Utah to take on the defensively - sound Jazz in the second half of a back - to - back set .
The Golden_State Warriors ( 25 - 1 ) took care of the Phoenix Suns ( 11 - 16 ) 128 - 103 on Wednesday to rebound after their first loss . The Warriors looked timid for the first 20 minutes of the game , but turned it on after that . They trailed for the majority of the first half , until Steph Curry caught fire and the team won the second quarter by 15 points . The most amazing stat is that the Warriors scored 79 points in the second and third quarters to run away with a dominant victory . Golden_State shot an amazing 52 percent from the field and recorded 32 assists in the blowout victory . The Suns first meeting with the Warriors was a similar result and they simply ca n't stop this potent offense . Aside from Brandon Knight 's 17 points , the other four starters combined for just 19 points . The bench did play well though , as Mirza Teletovic provided 24 points and T.J. Warren scored 19 . The team has won just four games in their last 15 and the defense is really killing them right now . The Suns will look to play better in their next game against the Cleveland Cavaliers on Friday . Steph Curry sat for the ninth time this season in the entirety of the fourth quarter and that stat alones tells the dominance of this team . Prior to sitting for the final 12 minutes , Curry tallied 25 points and seven assists . He wasn’t the hero tonight though , as Klay Thompson dropped 27 points in the third quarter en route to a 43 - point night . Draymond Green also provided yet another triple - double and it appears that one loss was a blip on the radar rather than a sign of future struggles . It 's scary to think what they 'll do to the Milwaukee Bucks in their next game on Friday , who ended their historic streak earlier in the week .
The Golden_State Warriors ( 27 - 1 ) defeated the Utah Jazz ( 12 - 15 ) 103 - 85 on Wednesday . The Warriors continue to dominate on their home court , extending a perfect a home record to 130 on the season . The team effort relied on fluid ball movement and showcased the rare occurrence where reigning MVP Stephen Curry does not perform to his elite ability . Curry finished well below his league leading 32 points per game and struggled with the long ball , as he scored 16 points , alongside nine assists and five rebounds on 5 - of - 14 shooting ( 2 - of - 8 from 3 - point territory ) . Klay Thompson led all scorers with 20 points , but the headlining numbers were added by Draymond Green and Andrew Bogut . Green is starting to gain more attention for his status in the league , and the power forward only added to his impressive 2015 - 2016 campaign with 15 points , nine rebounds , six assists and two blocks in 38 minutes . The Michigan State product entered Wednesday evening averaging 14 points , 9 rebounds and 7 assists .

The Jazz were unable to keep up with the ball movement , pace and defensive matchups that the Warriors threw their way . Utah shot 41 percent from the floor as a unit , which was not enough to keep the game within single digit striking distance . Four Jazz players finished in double figures , led by Derrick Favors’ 17 points and nine rebounds . Gordon Hayward proved to be the achilles heal in the loss , shooting 2 - of - 15 and posting a plus - minus of - 20 . Trey Burke and Alec Burks both played 27 points off the bench and each scored 13 points . The Warriors will host the Cleveland Cavaliers ( 19 - 7 ) in the heavily anticipated Christmas Day matchup on Friday , while the Jazz will host the Los Angeles Clippers ( 16 - 13 ) on Saturday .
The Golden_State Warriors ( 28 - 1 ) defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers ( 19 - 8 ) 89 - 83 on Friday . The 2015 Finals rematch featuring two of the very best in the NBA turned out to be more of a showcase for both teams ' often underrated defenses . Neither squad was able to put on much of an offensive display , and the game had more of the feel of a grind - it - out Eastern Conference battle , rather than the free - wheeling , high - scoring affairs typically played by the reigning champs .

The Warriors ( 50 - 11 ) knew that they 'd have a massive challenge on their hands in trying to make up for the extended absence of Kevin Durant ( knee ) , but also had to have a certain measure of confidence knowing that the Splash Bros. tandem that had been vastly successful before Durant 's arrival were ready to chuck away . That strategy fell woefully short Thursday , not necessarily in the margin of defeat , but rather , in overall offensive efficiency . Golden_State shot an atypical 39 percent from the floor , including an unsightly 20 percent ( 6 - for - 30 ) from behind the arc .

The Rockets ( 45 - 21 ) have been one of the NBA 's best squads all season , and a great deal of their success is rightfully attributed to their prolific offense . Typically , it 's the spectacular efforts of James Harden that spearhead the Houston attack , but Friday 's path to victory was a bit of a departure from the norm . It was the returning Ryan Anderson , who 'd missed the team 's tilt against the Jazz on Wednesday with a back injury , that led the way with 21 points , three rebounds and one steal .

The Bulls ( 34 - 38 ) came into Wednesday 's contest missing big man Robin Lopez , who 'd been suspended for his part in a fight with the Raptors ' Serge Ibaka on Tuesday evening .

Isaiah Thomas was huge for Boston ( 4 - 4 ) as he led the way offensively with 29 points on 9 - of - 17 shooting , in only 28 minutes . Thomas went 3 - of - 5 from deep , while the Celtics were great from downtown overall , hitting 11 - of - 27 . They shot only 39 percent from the field overall but made up for it with vicious defense , forcing 25 turnovers from the Knicks . Kelly Olynyk was solid in his second game back , with 19 points on 6 - of - 11 shooting , seven rebounds and three assists , in 30 minutes . Avery Bradley and Marcus Smart both filled the stat sheet . Smart finished with 12 points , 10 assists , six rebounds and three steals , while Bradley notched 15 points , 10 rebounds , two assists and four steals . The Celtics move to 3 - 1 at home and will head out for a two - game road trip beginning in Indiana on Saturday . With this loss the Knicks ( 3 - 5 ) fall to 1 - 3 on the road and have not achieved consecutive wins once yet this season . They were coming off a good win in Brooklyn but failed to carry that momentum into this one , which may have had something to do with the fact that Carmelo Anthony was ejected mid - second quarter . Anthony scored 12 points in 12 minutes before losing his temper . Kristaps Porzingis was the high - point man with 14 points , along with six rebounds and two blocks , in 23 minutes . Derrick Rose added 11 points , six assists and four rebounds , while the only other player to tally double - digits for the Knicks was Justin Holiday , with 10 . The Knicks can only look ahead , where they have to bring their best effort to Toronto for their second game in as many nights Saturday .
The Boston Celtics defeated the Dallas Mavericks , 90 - 83 , at TD Garden on Wednesday . The Mavericks ( 2 - 8 ) checked into Wednesday scoring the third - least points per game in the league ( 95 ) , and that trend would rear its ugly head yet again against a Boston squad that was ranked in the bottom 10 in points allowed . Playing once again without Dirk Nowitzki ( Achilles ) , Dallas got precious little production from anyone not named Harrison Barnes or Wesley Matthews . The two players combined for just over 60 percent of the team 's point total , and the Mavs managed just a 42 percent success rate from the field overall . Meanwhile , although the Celtics ( 6 - 5 ) did n't have much more offensive balance on their end , they benefited greatly from a game - high 30 points from Isaiah Thomas , with 22 of those coming in the fourth quarter .

Barea paced the reserves with nine points , six assists , two rebounds and a steal over 28 minutes in his stead .

The Clippers ( 7 - 1 ) took a 20 points lead at the end of the first quarter and simply built upon the Blazers ( 5 - 4 ) shooters being unable to bury a shot from the low post , to the midrange and behind the arc . It was not a particularly spectacular defensive effort by Los_Angeles , rather the matchup advantage of Chris Paul on Damian Lillard .

Injuries have led to Dion Waiters playing a much bigger role in Miami to start the season than the team originally planned , and while he 's already had five double - digit scoring performances , his efficiency has been subpar . His performance Tuesday night was yet another example , as Waiters shot just 5 - of - 18 from the field ( 28 percent ) . That marks the seventh time this season where the shooting guard has shot under 33 percent from the field , and he is shooting a horrid 31 percent overall .

Dion Waiters had an surprisingly hot start to the regular season in his first year with the Heat , as he became one of the primary scoring options on a struggling Miami team , but a groin injury in late November derailed the former Syracuse star and left him sidelined for a little over a month . Following his return on Jan. 4 , Waiters found the floor inconsistently as he worked his way back into basketball shape . But now , eight games later , Waiters ' efficiency and production has been out of this world . Following his 33 - point heroic performance against the Warriors on Monday , Waiters has now , in each of his last two games , scored 33 points in 33 minutes , and he has done so at a ridiculous efficiency . In those two performances , Waiters has shot 25 - of - 39 ( 64 percent ) from the field and 11 - of - 16 ( 69 percent ) from behind the arc . Miami , as winners of four straight , is hot , and Waiters is the biggest reason why .

Their opposition , the Pacers ( 32 - 30 ) , struggled mightily offensively outside of their star Paul George , who finished with a game - high 36 points on 15 - of - 25 shooting from the field , 10 rebounds and five assists in 36 minutes . Unfortunately for Indiana , those 36 points were nearly half of the team 's total points , and his teammates were ice cold from the field . Outside of George , the Pacers shot 22 - of - 56 ( 39 percent ) from the field , and their inability to support their start ultimately cost them Monday 's game . Up next , the Hornets will travel to Miami on Wednesday to take on the surging Heat , while the Pacers will look to bounce back Wednesday against the Pistons .
The Charlotte Hornets defeated the Washington Wizards , 98 - 93 , at Spectrum Center on Saturday night . The Wizards ( 42 - 27 ) checked into Saturday having played very well over their past two weeks , but also burning the proverbial candle at both ends . Washington had already played 13 games since the All-Star break , and had n't enjoyed two consecutive days off since just before the extended layoff . That pace was bound to catch up with them at some point , and it may have well been Saturday night . The Wizards appeared a bit sluggish on offense , with their final scoring tally representing their lowest since Feb. 26 . They shot just 37 percent from the field and 33 percent from three - point range while also turning the ball over 12 times . The Hornets ( 30 - 39 ) were able to capitalize on their visitors ' fatigue in the second half , when they outscored the Wizards by a 59 - 53 margin to pull off the home victory . John Wall led Washington with a modest 19 points , which he supplemented with eight assists , three rebounds , two blocks and one steal . Bradley Beal was next with 18 points , three boards , two assists , one steal and one block . Otto Porter , Jr. followed with 16 points , three rebounds , one assist and three steals .

Bojan Bogdanovic led the bench with 12 points , three rebounds and one assist . Cody Zeller paced Charlotte with 19 points , five rebounds , four steals and two blocks . Kemba Walker and Marvin Williams supplied matching 16 - point efforts , with the former adding six assists and two rebounds and the latter registering eight rebounds , three assists and two steals . Nicolas Batum returned after a multi - game absence due to migraines and tallied eight points , 10 rebounds and five assists . Frank Kaminsky III paced the reserves with 14 points , four boards , two assists and one block . Marco Belinelli was productive off the bench as well with 11 points , two assists and one rebound .

The host Utah Jazz beat the visiting Los_Angeles Lakers on Friday , 96 - 89 . It was the season debut for banged - up Jazz star Derrick Favors . Favors missed the majority of the preseason and the team 's season opener with a bruised knee , but was able to transition back into a limited role for Friday 's contest . The forward came off the bench for an impressive 15 points and nine rebounds in 20 minutes , but showed some signs of rust , turning the ball over five times . His typical frontcourt partner , French seven - footer Rudy Gobert , made a major impact on the defensive end with four blocks . Gobert 's six offensive rebounds also helped the Jazz overcome a poor perimeter shooting night , offering Utah a number of second - chance attempts . The Lakers , meanwhile , received troubling news , as rookie Brandon Ingram was forced to leave the game with a knee injury after just four minutes of play . Though not appearing to be serious , the second overall pick will likely be monitored closely going forward . It was a tough night for young Lakers in general , as guard D'Angelo Russell went just 3 - for - 14 from the field , while forward Julius Randle scored just seven points and recorded only four rebounds . The Lakers did manage to find a scoring boost off the bench , as sixth man Lou Williams led the team with 17 . Both teams will travel on Sunday , with the Jazz visiting the Los_Angeles Clippers and the Lakers taking on the Thunder in Oklahoma City .
At 25 years old , it seems Kawhi Leonard is experience statistical growth in almost every category . With 29 on Friday , Leonard is now averaging 29 points per game through his first six contests . He is also averaging a career - high four assists per game through the first six contests . While both numbers are impressive for the two - time Defensive Player of the Year , it seems that where Leonard is exerting the most statistical dominance is the free - throw line . Kawhi went a perfect 10 - for - 10 from the line on Friday , and has now missed just two of his 55 free - throw attempts on the season . As the season continues , it will be seen if Leonard 's significant growth in most box score columns is sustainable . It was a tale of two teams from the free - throw line on Friday , as the Spurs ( with Leonard 's assistance ) shot over 90 percent from the charity stripe . Utah , meanwhile , did not fare as well , hitting just 65 percent of their attempts at the line .
While the start of the Grizzlies ' season has been pretty standard with a 5 - 5 start , Vince Carter 's play has been anything but . With his 20 - point performance on Monday , Carter notched 20 points for the second time in three games and at least 17 points for the third straight game . While Chandler Parson 's return from a knee injury was expected to lead to a much - reduced role for Carter , it 's done the exact opposite , as with Parson 's struggling as he still works to make his way back to the floor , Carter has excelled and outscored Parsons in each of the past three games . Carter 's 9 points per game would be his highest average since the 2013 - 14 season . For the Jazz , they received an unexpected 20 - point performance from Joe Ingles on Monday - - a performance that kept the team in the game with Gordon Hayward struggling to get anything going . Ingles had n't scored in double figures all season until Monday , and with Derrick Favors potentially out , the team could look to Ingles to provide some added scoring on a more consistent basis when they 're a man down .
Atlanta is not accustomed to being held to 68 points on 31 percent shooting , but they have n't seen a defense like the one Utah possesses . The Jazz actually ranked first in the NBA with under 95 points a game allowed and that number surely dropped here . Dennis Schroeder was the only starter to play well for the Hawks , as he scored 16 points on an inefficient 6 - of - 19 shooting . Gordon Hayward was the player of the game for Utah , as he dropped 24 points and seven rebounds . George Hill was n't far behind , finishing with 23 points and five rebounds . Double-doubles by Rudy Gobert and Trey Lyles were huge as well .

Overall , the Jazz shot very well , going 17 - of - 30 from three - point range and shooting 54 percent overall .
On Friday , the Raptors saw a combined 60 points from their All-Star guards .

DeMar DeRozan , meanwhile , scored 24 and recorded four steals on the defensive end . Despite playing just 16 minutes and facing stiff competition in Utah center Rudy Gobert , Toronto big man Jonas Valanciunas scored 14 points on perfect 5 - of - 5 shooting and had seven rebounds . For Utah , forward Gordon Hayward led the way with 23 points . Hayward shot 50 percent from the field and had five assists . Gobert scored 13 and led the team with 14 rebounds while shooting a solid 5 - of - 7 . Sophomore Trey Lyles impressed off the bench , scoring 19 points including four threes .
Kevin Love has had a great start to the 2016 - 17 season and has looked like his old self , averaging 22 points and 11 rebounds per game thus far . His start to January , however , has been anything but great . Tuesday night against the Jazz , Love posted just 12 points and nine rebounds in 37 minutes while shooting a sorry 4 - of - 14 from the field and 2 - of - 6 from behind the arc . When comparing it to the first two months of the season , it would be completely out of character , but when compared to his other games this January , it looks much more normal . In the three games he 's played this month , Love has shot over 33 percent from the field just once and is shooting a woeful 27 percent from behind the arc to start the new year . So , while his numbers look solid - - he 's averaging 17 points and 11 rebounds through those four games - - Love is playing at an alarmingly inefficient rate .
The Jazz fell behind by a 42 - 29 margin after one quarter , but limited Orlando to just 65 points the rest of the way .

In fact , the Celtics went 24 - of - 36 from the field to lead by 14 points at the half , as it never got within six points from there . It was a wire - to - wire win for Boston , as Utah could n't climb back into the game . The shooting was just as lopsided for the whole game , with the Celtics shooting 59 percent and Utah hitting just 41 percent of their shots . The assist - to - turnover differential was decisive as well , with the Celtics recording four more assists than the Jazz and committing nine less turnovers . The Celtics ( 35 - 19 ) have been one of the best teams in the NBA over recent weeks and a road win in Utah just adds to their impressive resume ' .

Gobert , one of the front - runners for the Defensive Player of the Year award , also blocked four shots and pulled down 13 rebounds . The ridiculous efficiency the Jazz got out of Gobert lifted the team 's shooting percentage to a respectable 46 percent despite cold nights from a number of other players . This included a 6 - of - 17 shooting night from All-Star forward Gordon Hayward . Another area in which the Jazz excelled was turnovers . The team coughed the ball up just seven times on the night .

The personnel shifts did n't affect the quality of play in the least , and in fact , may have enhanced it . The two teams engaged in an entertaining back - and - forth battle that was n't decided until the final seconds , when a Joakim Noah shot attempt failed to find the net .

On the contrary , the Knicks shot 50 percent from the field and 64 percent from three - point range . Kawhi Leonard carried the Spurs , as he tallied 36 points , nine rebounds , four assists and four steals . LaMarcus Aldridge was the only San_Antonio player with more than 10 points , as he totaled 15 points and 10 rebounds .

The Golden_State Warriors defeated the New_York Knicks , 112 - 105 , at Madison Square Garden on Sunday afternoon . Coming into Sunday , the Warriors ( 51 - 11 ) were looking to reestablish their confidence after falling flat in their first game without Kevin Durant ( knee ) on Thursday . The prolific Splash Bros made sure of that , putting together a performance that hearkened back to last season by combining for 60 points , including nine three - pointers . No other player on the team scored more than 13 but it proved to be enough to hold off a feisty Knicks ( 25 - 38 ) squad that kept matters close until the closing minute . New_York got a pair of standout performances in their own right from Derrick Rose and Kristaps Porzingis , who nearly matched Curry and Thompson basket - for - basket with 53 combined points of their own . The Warriors notably lost the rebound battle by a 47 - 35 margin , but took much better care of the ball , turning it over only eight times as compared the Knicks ' 15 . Curry led the way with a game - high 31 points , which he supplemented with eight rebounds , six assists and two steals . Thompson was right behind him with 29 points , four boards , one assist and one steal . Green filled out the stat sheet with 13 points , seven rebounds , four assists , two steals and one block . Zaza Pachulia provided 10 points , two assists , one rebound , one steal and one block . Rose paced the Knicks with 28 points on 9 - of - 18 shooting from the floor and a 10 - of - 11 tally from the free - throw line . He added four assists , one rebound and one steal . Porzingis compiled a 24 - point , 15 - rebound double - double that also included two assists and two blocks . With his two teammates taking on such expanded roles Sunday , Carmelo Anthony turned in a rather modest 15 points , six rebounds , two assists and two blocks . Lance Thomas surprisingly went scoreless over 27 minutes , although he did supply seven boards and two assists . Justin Holiday led the bench with 10 points , three rebounds and one assist . The Warriors now head south to the Peach State for a Monday night showdown with the Atlanta Hawks , while the Knicks travel to Central Florida to tangle with the Orlando Magic on Monday evening as well .
While the Pacers have lost two of their last three games , Paul George has been carrying the load for them offensively and on the glass . Tuesday 's loss to New_York was yet another example of the swingman putting his offensive and rebounding prowess on display . George finished Tuesday 's game with a team - high 22 points and 10 rebounds , and it was his third straight game with a double - double from points and rebounds . He 's now averaging 23 points and 10 rebounds over those three contests . Across from George on Tuesday , Carmelo Anthony notched a double - double of his own , scoring 22 points and grabbing a game - high 13 rebounds . For Anthony , however , this is a less common occurrence , with Tuesday being his first double - double since late January . Anthony is also on pace this season to have the lowest rebounding averaging of his career since his 2005 - 6 campaign when he averaged just 5 per game .
While the Warriors have seen some cold shooting nights so far this season , Friday 's matchup saw the worst splits for the team in recent memory . Reigning MVP Steph Curry went 0 - for - 10 from beyond the arc , failing to hit a three - pointer for the first time in 157 games . As the NBA record fell , Curry 's backcourt partner Klay Thompson saw struggles of his own , going just 2 - of - 10 from downtown . On the whole , the Warriors went just 5 - of - 32 from beyond the arc , their lowest three - point output of the season . Rebounding proved to be another major factor in the game . Los_Angeles forward Julius Randle pulled down a season - high 14 boards , helping to give the Lakers a 51 - 40 rebounding advantage . Sophomore Larry Nance Jr. also provided a force in the paint , contributing nine rebounds and 12 points on perfect shooting .
Julius Randle may not be as much of a highlight reel as compared to the rest of the Los_Angeles Lakers , but the Kentucky product is quietly taking his stats up a notch . Although it 's a small sample size of just seven games , Randle has improved across almost every statistical category from his 2015 - 2016 season where he played 81 games . The Lakers forward is averaging 14 points , 8 rebounds and 3 assists per game while shooting 60 percent overall . Randle continued the strong start with 18 points on 6 - of - 9 shooting against the Phoenix Suns in the win on Sunday . The minutes management for the deep Lakers squad could be the reasoning behind the shared success among the first seven games . Randle saw 28 minutes of action Sunday , while D’Angelo Russell ( 28 minutes ) and Nick Young ( 36 minutes ) saw slightly more than the third - year forward . As for the bench , Brandon Ingram , Lou Williams and Jordan Clarkson all saw more than 25 minutes of action .
In a battle between a veteran team and a young team , the more veteran core escaped with a victory . Jimmy Butler continues his fantastic run , as he tallied 40 points , seven rebounds and six assists in the win . Nikola Mirotic started for the rested Dwyane Wade and finished with 15 points and 15 rebounds . The key for Chicago was the rebounding , as they snatched down 56 rebounds , while holding Los_Angeles to just 37 on their end . The Bulls also shot 52 percent from the field , while holding the Lakers to 44 percent . Lou Williams and Larry Nance Jr. were the leading scorers for the Lakers , as they combined for 43 points off the bench . The bench was n't all good though , as Jordan Clarkson went 1 - of - 12 in a forgettable game . The five Los_Angeles starters combined for just 51 points , while the Bulls got 89 points from their five starters .
The Golden_State Warriors defeated the host Los_Angeles Lakers , 109 - 85 , on Friday at Staple Center . This was the second game of a home - and - home series between the Lakers and Warriors that resulted in two wins for the Warriors . Golden_State came out in the last game with an 80 - point first half as they looked to make a point against the team that had upset them early in the season . Since their loss to the Lakers early in the season , the Warriors have now won 10 games in a row , while setting a franchise - record with their 10th game with 30 assists or more . The Warriors ( 14 - 2 ) started off strong with a 30 - 20 first quarter . They tied the second quarter , with both teams scoring 23 but Golden_State went on to dominate the final two quarters and cruise to victory . The win did come at a price though as Draymond Green left the game with an ankle tweak , and Ian Clark left after being accidentally hit in the throat . Meanwhile , Kevin Durant led the Warriors in scoring with 29 points , along with nine assists and six rebounds , in 33 minutes , while Stephen Curry added 24 points and Klay Thompson chipped in 18 , as the three combined for a modest 71 points . The Warriors will have short rest before their next game in Minnesota on Saturday . The Lakers ( 8 - 9 ) were short - handed in this one , missing D'Angelo Russell ( knee ) , Julius Randal ( hip ) and Nick Young ( toe ) . Jordan Clarkson was the high - point man for Los_Angeles , with 20 points , on 6 - of - 15 shooting , including 4 - of - 9 from deep , in 38 minutes . The only other players to score in double figures for the Lakers were Larry Nance Jr. , with 11 and Lou Williams with 13 . Los_Angeles shot 36 percent from the field as a team and only 5 - of - 22 from deep as it was stifled by the Warriors . Next the Lakers play host to the Hawks on Sunday .
Lou Williams led all scorers with 38 points in 34 minutes off the bench , but it was not enough to secure a victory , as the Utah Jazz went on to claim the road win at Staples Center . Utah capitalized off sharing the ball , noted by their 26 assists as a unit , and that all five starters finished in double figures scoring . Rudy Gobert 's efforts on both end of the floor continue to drive the Jazz , and he went on to finish with 14 points , 17 rebounds and five blocks in 39 minutes . Gordon Hayward once again led the Jazz in scoring , although the volume of shots was not perfectly in sync with the output , Hayward managed 23 points , six rebounds , five assists and two steals on 7 - of - 16 shooting , including three shots buried from behind the arc .
The Dallas Mavericks defeated the host Los_Angeles Lakers , 101 - 89 , at Staples Center on Thursday .

Strangely enough , there was only one tie and two lead changes , as that one momentum swing was extremely decisive .

They also dominated the rebounding and assists , as they won the rebounding differential , 42 - 34 and the assist battle , 24 - 15 .

The Orlando Magic defeated the Sacramento Kings , 102 - 94 , at Amway Center on Thursday . The blueprints of the Magic ( 2 - 3 ) and Kings ( 2 - 4 ) were both on display Thursday , and Orlando showed why it 's sometimes better to have a collection of above - average players than a top - heavy attack heavily focused on one superstar talent . The Magic received a standout performance from Evan Fournier , who tallied a season - high 29 points , as well as double - digit scoring efforts from three other members of the first unit , and a double - digit assist performance from the one member of the group who did n't get there , Elfrid Payton . Meanwhile , the Kings received the lights - out production they are used to seeing from DeMarcus Cousins , while the rest of the starters struggled to maintain consistency through four quarters .

San_Antonio rested Tony Parker , Manu Ginobili and Pau Gasol on the second leg , but still managed to put together a solid offensive performance , shooting 47 percent from the field and an astounding 58 percent from behind the arc .

The team held a major advantage in the turnover column , committing only nine while forcing Cleveland to turn the ball over 17 times .

James , meanwhile , led the team per usual with 23 points , nine rebounds , and nine assists . The outing was not enough to earn the win or make up for the absence of injured All-Star Kevin Love , however .
Salah Mejri 's performance in Wednesday 's victory over the 76ers was more than just a completely surprise , it was completely out of character . With his 16 - point , 17 - rebound performance , Mejri scored the second highest point total of his career , with 17 being the highest , and recorded a career - high 17 rebounds in just 21 minutes . In the season and a half he 's played in the NBA , Mejri had recorded just two career double - doubles before Wednesday night , and they both came against the Trail Blazers within three days of each other . This season alone , Mejri only had two games where he recorded double - digit rebounds and Wednesday was his first double - digit scoring outing of the 2016 - 17 season . With Bogut steal dealing with a lingering hamstring injury , Mejri 's performance against Philadelphia may have given the Mavericks some much - needed insurance in their frontcourt rotation .

It was smooth sailing for Denver ( 26 - 32 ) , who earned a bounce - back win after falling to the Kings on Thursday night . Like Thursday night , however , star Denver center Nikola Jokic was a complete non - factor . The 21 - year - old played only 14 minutes and picked up four fouls while scoring only two points . A big night from Jokic was n't necessary for Denver 's success , though , as three Nuggets scored at least 20 points on the night . The team 's high - scorer was shooting guard Gary Harris , who posted 25 points . Overall , Denver shot a stellar 50 percent from the field including 14 three - pointers and held a nine - rebound advantage on the glass . Brooklyn ( 9 - 48 ) , meanwhile , appears far from getting back on track . While injuries to key players such as Jeremy Lin have played a role , the Nets have simply performed at a low level throughout the season . Brooklyn has now lost 15 consecutive games and remains significantly behind in the Eastern Conference standings . On Friday , the team saw a fairly respectable offensive night but a miserable defensive one . The Nets shot over 49 percent but were outscored by 20 . A big issue for Brooklyn was turnovers , as the team coughed the ball up 19 times on the night . The Nets will visit Golden State on Saturday , while Denver will host the Grizzlies on Sunday .
The Washington Wizards defeated the Denver Nuggets , 123 - 113 , Wednesday at Pepsi Center . The Wizards ( 39 - 24 ) , who have now won three straight road games to improve their record away from home to 13 - 15 , won Wednesday 's matchup in fairly effortless fashion , as they opened up the game early and went into halftime with a 17 - point lead . That was thanks in large part to an incredibly hot shooting performance from Washington , as they shot 57 percent from the field and 42 percent from behind the arc . The Wizards were once again led by a pair of great performances from their starting backcourt , with John Wall posting a game - high 30 points and 10 assists , while Bradley Beal scored 23 points of his own . The two shot a combined 21 - of - 36 ( 58 percent ) from the field . For the Nuggets ( 29 - 35 ) , Wednesday 's defeat marked their second loss in their last three games , and it was thanks in large part to their lack of defense , as Denver was pretty solid on the offensive side of the ball . As a team , the Nuggets shot 53 percent from the field and a scorching 46 percent from behind the arc , but the 123 points they gave up ended up being too much to overcome . Gary Harris led the way for Denver , shooting 10 - of - 15 from the field and 6 - of - 9 from behind the arc en route to scoring a game - high 26 points . Wilson Chandler added 21 points of his own , while Mason Plumlee added 19 points and 10 rebounds for a double - double . Up next , the Wizards will head to Sacramento on Friday to take on the Kings , while the Nuggets will head home Friday and play the Celtics .
It was a dominant offensive performance Wednesday from the Wizards ' three young stars in John Wall , Bradley Beal and Otto Porter Jr. Not only did the three starters put up impressive scoring numbers , but they did so in very efficient fashion . With Wall 's 30 points , Beal 's 25 and Porter 's 22 , the trio combined to score an impressive 63 percent of Washington 's 123 points Wednesday . But what is even more astounding , is that they hardly missed any shots in the process . Wall , Beal and Porter combined to shoot a scorching 31 - of - 49 ( 63 percent ) from the field and 9 - of - 16 ( 56 percent ) from behind the arc . That shooting ended up being contagious , as the other two starters managed to shoot over 50 percent from the field as well , and as a team , the Wizards shot a wildly impressive 57 percent .
The Denver Nuggets posted some remarkable shooting numbers as a unit , as they went 54 percent from the field in a hot handed night for multiple players . Nikola Jokic and Danilo Gallinari each scored 18 points , and combined for 12 rebounds and nine assists . Mason Plumlee scored 15 points and added 10 rebounds across 36 minutes . Jamal Murray and Will Barton each pitched in 22 points and each played 30 minutes , and combined for nine three - pointers . Jokic finished 8 - of - 13 from the field , Murray went 8 - of - 13 as well , while Barton finished 7 - of - 12 to round out the strong trio . Lakers Ivan Zubac drew the start at center and offered a bright spot in the box score . Zubac scored 25 points , grabbed 11 rebounds and dished out an assist in 30 minutes . Jordan Clarkson added 19 points on 7 - of - 18 shooting , while Brandon Ingram pitched in 14 points , one rebound and two assists .
Considering how close this game was , it was strange how the lead was split . In fact , the Lakers led for less than four minutes of this game and the two teams were within six points for nearly the entirety of the fourth quarter . The Lakers bench was the only thing keeping it close , as they outscored the starters 64 - 44 . Six bench players played at least 14 minutes for Los_Angeles , with no starter playing more than 21 minutes . The five Indiana starters actually outscored the Los_Angeles starters 79 - 44 . Despite playing just 20 minutes in this game due to foul trouble , Juluis Randle fell one point shy of a double - double with his nine points and 10 rebounds . Thaddeus Young was the only starter in this game to shoot above 50 percent from the field , as he went 6 - for - 8 in a 14 - point , six - rebound performance .
The Magic had trouble mustering offense on anything resembling a consistent basis Monday and saw Evan Fournier lead the team with just 14 points . Elfrid Payton was next with 12 points , while Nikola Vucevic was just 1 - of - 10 from the field , but did contribute 12 boards . Aaron Gordon was the only other player to reach double digits in the scoring column , posting 11 points off the bench . The Pacers posted their best defensive effort of the season , holding the Magic to a season - low 69 points , a 32 field - goal percentage , and a 20 percent tally from three - point range . Paul George and Monta Ellis each posted 13 - point efforts , while Thaddeus Young and Jeff Teague each supplied 11 points . C.J. Miles led the team with 16 points , which he accomplished off the bench over an efficient 23 minutes .
The Indiana Pacers defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers , 103 - 93 , at Bankers Life Fieldhouse on Wednesday . The Cavaliers ( 9 - 2 ) , coming off a hard - fought shootout with the Toronto Raptors on Tuesday , announced earlier in the day that both LeBron James and J.R. Smith would both miss the game for rest . That propelled Richard Jefferson and Iman Shumpert into the starting five , and put an even bigger - than - usual spotlight on Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love . The latter duo did combine for 51 points , but conversely , the pair of spot starters could only muster nine points overall . That left a certain scoring vacuum that Cleveland simply could n't overcome , leading to only the second loss of the season for the defending champs . Love led all scorers with 27 points , 16 rebounds and an assist . Irving was next with 24 points , seven assists , two rebounds and a steal . With such a large share of the offensive responsibility , both players combined to put up 43 shot attempts . Tristan Thompson could n't help on the scoreboard either , posting just two points , but he did haul in 12 rebounds , dished out three assists and recorded a block . Rookie Kay Felder and Jordan McRae paced the reserves with a pair of nine - point efforts , with the point total representing a career high for the former . The Pacers ( 6 - 6 ) saw four - fifths of their first unit manage double - digit scoring and were led by Paul George , who supplied 21 points , 11 rebounds , five assists , two steals and a block . Jeff Teague registered 20 points , eight assists , four rebounds , a steal and a block . Thaddeus Young totaled 16 points , seven boards , an assist and a steal , while Myles Turner tallied 12 points , eight rebounds , four blocks and a steal . C.J. Miles paced the reserves with 10 points and a steal . The Cavaliers head back home for a Friday night date with the Detroit Pistons , while the Pacers remain home and await the Phoenix Suns for a Friday evening tussle .
With LeBron James and J.R. Smith both missing Wednesday 's game for rest , Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love took on even more offensive responsibility than usual . They combined for 51 points , which included Love 's 27 - point , 16 - rebound double - double , but it was n't enough to overcome a lack of production from the rest of the roster . Richard Jefferson and Iman Shumpert , the respective replacements for the idle starters , could only muster a combined nine points on 3 - of - 12 shooting , and the Cavs did n't receive any other double - digit scoring efforts besides those of the aforementioned superstars . The Pacers ' effort sharply contrasted from Cleveland 's , as they saw four - fifths of their first unit hit double digits in the scoring column . Paul George led the way with a 21 - point , 11 - rebound double - double , and Jeff Teague , Myles Turner and Thaddeus Young contributed another 48 points combined .
The Indiana Pacers defeated the Los_Angeles Clippers , 91 - 70 , at Bankers Life Fieldhouse on Sunday , The Clippers have been playing some dominant basketball this season , but this was a dud against a desperate Pacers team . Indiana stifled them with their defense , holding them to 70 points on 31 percent from the field and 17 percent from three - point range . The assist - to - turnover ratio was a huge factor as well , with Indiana recording 26 assists to just 14 turnovers and Los_Angeles committing 20 turnovers to just 11 assists . Those numbers allowed the Pacers to take 22 more shots than the Clippers , making nearly twice as many shots . Los_Angeles ( 14 - 4 ) has been one of the best teams early on in the season , but they really struggled here . Blake Griffin led the team in scoring , tallying 16 points and nine rebounds on 6 - of - 15 shooting . Chris Paul also struggled with his shot , totaling 13 points , four rebounds and four assists on 4 - of - 11 from the field . The only other player in double figures was Jamal Crawford , who scored 12 points off the bench . DeAndre Jordan grabbed 14 rebounds , adding eight points to his line . Los_Angeles will look to play better on Tuesday against the Brooklyn Nets , Indiana ( 9 - 9 ) had to play this game without Paul George ( ankle ) , but they did n't miss a beat . Myles Turner was the player of the game , accruing 17 points and 12 rebounds in the win . Glenn Robinson III also scored 17 points , filling - in for George . Jeff Teague scored just seven points , but dished out 10 assists , Al Jefferson and Rodney Stuckey were nice sparks off the bench , accumulating 28 points and 13 rebounds between the two . Indiana will look to get above .500 in their next matchup against the Portland Trail Blazers on Wednesday .

That was on display Monday , as George and Turner co - led the team with 22 points on a combined 18 - of - 34 shooting . Meanwhile , while Monta Ellis sat out the contest with a groin strain , Rodney Stuckey was able to provide a scoring lift off the bench in his stead , pacing the second unit with 14 points .

They were led by a pair of 13 - point efforts from Marvin Williams and Nicolas Batum , with the former adding two assists , two rebounds and two steals while the latter hauled in 10 boards and dished out three assists .

Tobias Harris and Darrun Hilliard , who started in place of Kentavious Caldwell-Pope ( knee ) , only mustered a combined 13 points .
Over the last five games , 76ers star Joel Embiid has been absent due to a knee contusion , and that opened the door for backup center and former No . 3 overall draft pick Jahlil Okafor to prove his worth to the organization - - or other organizations for that matter . Okafor has played in four of those five games , as he sat out for precautionary reasons in one , and in those four games , he 's given mixed results . While offensively Okafor has been somewhat productive in averaging 14 points per game following his 16 - point performance Monday , he has n't done so at a very efficient rate . Okafor has failed to shoot over 50 percent in three of those four games , and considering how he does the majority of his work near the basket , shooting 46 percent overall in that stretch is not a very impressive mark .

Westbrook 's night was n't the most efficient , however , as he shot just 12 - of - 35 from the field and 1 - of - 6 from behind the arc . Victor Oladipo , on the other hand , had a very efficient evening , shooting 10 - of - 16 from the field en route to 25 points on top of six rebounds and six assists .

After a highly entertaining , back - and - forth affair that saw both teams often match each other bucket for bucket , the Thunder ( 43 - 30 ) looked like they 'd finally built an insurmountable 98 - 92 cushion with 25 seconds remaining . No one gave the trio of Jayson Tatum , Terry Rozier and Marcus Morris the memo , however , as they all drained clutch baskets over the final 18 seconds to seal the improbable comeback . Rozier 's 27 - foot three - pointer with 13 seconds remaining followed a free - throw line sequence by Russell Westbrook where he had a key miss on the first of his two shots . The trey left the home squad down only two , and then Carmelo Anthony subsequently missed two more attempts from the charity stripe - - the second of which was rebounded by Tatum .
