# adding_data
Code and other material for the INLG2020 paper [Studying the Impact of Filling Information Gaps on the Output Quality ofNeural Data-to-Text](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.inlg-1.6/).  Also included, are the data files from the experiment in the [SportSett](https://github.com/nlgcat/sport_sett_basketball) paper.  I encourage anyone who wants to use data in this domain to read the SportSett paper first, as it explains the data modelling problem, as well why the training/validation/partition scheme has been changed (there is cross-partition contamination in Rotowire on the encoder end).
